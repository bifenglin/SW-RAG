Here\n$\\vec u_E := (\\hat{\\vec b} \\times \\nabla \\phi)/B$ gives the electric drift\nvelocity in a magnetic field $\\vec B := B \\hat{\\vec b}$ and an electric\npotential $\\phi$. We neglect contributions of the diamagnetic drift~\\cite{Kube2016}.\n\n\n\n\nEquation~\\eqref{eq:generala} is closed by invoking quasineutrality, i.e. the divergence of the ion polarization, \nthe electron diamagnetic and the gravitational drift currents must vanish\n\\begin{align}\n  \\nabla\\cdot\\left( \\frac{n}{\\Omega} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \n  + \\vec u_E \\cdot\\nabla  \\right)\\frac{\\nabla_\\perp \\phi}{B}  + n\\vec u_d - n\\vec u_g\\right) &=0\n  . \n \n \n  \\label{eq:generalb}\n\\end{align}\nHere we denote \n$\\nabla_\\perp\\phi/B := - \\hat{\\vec b} \\times \\vec u_E$, \nthe electron diamagnetic drift\n$\\vec u_d := - T_e(\\hat{\\vec b} \\times\\nabla n ) /enB$\nwith the electron temperature $T_e$,\nthe ion gravitational drift velocity  \n$\\vec u_g := m_i \\hat{\\vec b} \\times \\vec g /B$\nwith ion mass $m_i$, and the ion gyro-frequency\n$\\Omega := eB/m_i$.\n\nCombining Eq.~\\eqref{eq:generalb} with Eq.~\\eqref{eq:generala} yields\n\\begin{align}\n \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot\\left( \\rho\\vec u_E \\right) + \\nabla \\cdot\\left( n(\\vec u_\\psi + \\vec u_d + \\vec u_g) \\right) &= 0\\label{eq:vorticity}\n\\end{align}\nwith the polarization charge density \n$\\rho = \\nabla\\cdot( n\\nabla_\\perp \\phi / \\Omega B)$ \nand\n$\\vec u_\\psi := \\hat{\\vec b}\\times \\nabla\\psi /B$ \nwith \n$\\psi:= m_i\\vec u_E^2 /2e$.\nWe exploit this form of Eq.~\\eqref{eq:generalb} in our numerical simulations.\n\nEquations~\\eqref{eq:generala} and \\eqref{eq:generalb} respectively \\eqref{eq:vorticity} have several invariants.\nFirst, in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:generala} the relative particle number \n$M(t) := \\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, (n-n_0)$ is conserved over time\n$\\d M(t)/\\d t = 0$. \nFurthermore, we integrate \n$( T_e(1+\\ln n) -T_e \\ln B)\\partial_t n$\nas well as\n$-e\\phi \\partial_t\\rho - (m_i\\vec u_E^2/2+gm_ix - T_e\\ln B)\\partial_t n$ \nover the domain to get, disregarding boundary contributions,\n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{\\d}{\\d t}\\left[T_eS(t) + H(t) \\right] = 0, \\label{eq:energya}\\\\ \n    \\frac{\\d}{\\d t} \\left[ E(t) - G(t) - H(t)\\right] =  0,\n    \\label{eq:energyb}\n\\end{align}\nwhere we define \nthe entropy\n$S(t):=\\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, [n\\ln(n/n_0) - (n-n_0)]$,  \nthe kinetic energy \n$E(t):=m_i \\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, n\\vec u_E^2/2$ \nand the potential energies\n$G(t) := m_i g\\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, x(n-n_0)$\nand\n$H(t) := T_e\\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, (n-n_0) \\ln (B^{-1})$.\nNote that $n\\ln( n/n_0) - n + n_0 \\approx (n-n_0)^2/2$ for $|(n-n_0)/n_0| \\ll 1$ and $S(t)$ thus reduces to the \nlocal entropy form in Reference~\\cite{Kube2016}. \n\nWe now set up a gravitational field $\\vec g = g\\hat x$ and a constant homogeneous background\nmagnetic field $\\vec B = B_0 \\hat z$ in a Cartesian coordinate system.\nThen the divergences of the electric and gravitational drift velocities $\\nabla\\cdot\\vec u_E$ and $\\nabla\\cdot\\vec u_g$\nand the diamagnetic current $\\nabla\\cdot(n\\vec u_d)$ vanish, which makes the \nflow incompressible. Furthermore, the magnetic potential energy vanishes $H(t) = 0$.\n\nIn a second system we model the inhomogeneous magnetic field present in tokamaks as\n$\\vec B := B_0 (1+ x/R_0)^{-1}\\hat z$ and neglect the gravitational drift $\\vec u_g = 0$.\nThen, the potential energy $G(t) = 0$. \nNote that \n$H(t) = m_i \\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}^2/R_0\\int\\mathrm{dA}\\, x(n-n_0) +\\mathcal O(R_0^{-2}) $\nreduces to $G(t)$ with the effective gravity $g_\\text{eff}:= \\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}^2/R_0$ with $\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}^2 := T_e/m_i$. \nFor the rest of this letter we treat $g$ and $g_\\text{eff}$ as well as $G(t)$ and $H(t)$ on the same footing.\nThe magnetic field inhomogeneity thus entails compressible flows, which is \nthe only difference to the model describing dynamics in a homogeneous magnetic field introduced above. \nSince both $S(t)\\geq 0$ and $E(t)\\geq 0$ we further derive from Eq.~\\eqref{eq:energya} and Eq.~\\eqref{eq:energyb} that the kinetic energy\nis bounded by $E(t) \\leq T_eS(t) + E(t) = T_e S(0)$; a feature absent from the gravitational system with \nincompressible flows, where $S(t) = S(0)$. \n\nWe now show that the invariants Eqs.~\\eqref{eq:energya} and \\eqref{eq:energyb} present restrictions on the velocity and\nacceleration of plasma blobs. \nFirst, we define the blobs' center of mass (COM) via $X(t):= \\int\\mathrm{dA}\\, x(n-n_0)/M$ and \nits COM velocity as $V(t):=\\d X(t)/\\d t$. \nThe latter is proportional to the total radial particle flux~\\cite{Garcia_Bian_Fundamensky_POP_2006, Held2016a}.\nWe assume\nthat $n>n_0$ and $(n-n_0)^2/2 \\leq [ n\\ln (n/n_0) - (n-n_0)]n $ to show for both systems \n\\begin{align}\n  (MV)^2 &= \\left( \\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, n{\\phi_y}/{B} \\right)^2\n  = \\left( \\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, (n-n_0){\\phi_y}/{B} \\right)^2\\nonumber\\\\\n \n&\\leq 2 \\left( \\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, \\left[n\\ln (n/n_0) -(n-n_0)\\right]^{1/2}\\sqrt{n}{\\phi_y}/{B}\\right)^2\\nonumber\\\\\n \n  &\\leq 4 S(0) E(t)/m_i \n \n  \\label{eq:inequality}\n\\end{align}\nHere we use the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and \n$\\phi_y:=\\partial\\phi/\\partial y$. \nNote that although we derive the inequality Eq.~\\eqref{eq:inequality} only for amplitudes $\\triangle n >0$  we assume that the results also hold for depletions. This is justified by our numerical results later in this letter. \nIf we initialize our density field with a seeded blob of radius $\\ell$ and amplitude $\\triangle n$ as \n\\begin{align}\n  n(\\vec x, 0) &= n_0 + \\triangle n \\exp\\left( -\\frac{\\vec x^2}{2\\ell^2} \\right), \\label{eq:inita}\n \n \n\\end{align}\nand  \n$\\phi(\\vec x, 0 ) = 0$,\nwe immediately have $M := M(0) = 2\\pi \\ell^2 \\triangle n$, $E(0) = G(0) = 0$ and \n$S(0) = 2\\pi \\ell^2 f(\\triangle n)$, where $f(\\triangle n)$ captures the amplitude dependence of \nthe integral for $S(0)$. \n\nThe acceleration for both incompressible and compressible flows can be estimated\nby assuming a linear acceleration $V=A_0t$ and $X=A_0t^2/2$~\\cite{Held2016a} and using \n$E(t) = G(t) = m_igMX(t)$ in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:inequality}\n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{A_0}{g} =  \\mathcal Q\\frac{2S(0)}{M} \\approx \\frac{\\mathcal Q}{2} \\frac{\\triangle n }{n_0+2\\triangle n/9}.\n  \\label{eq:acceleration}\n\\end{align}\nHere, we use the Pad\\'e approximation of order $(1/1)$ of $2S(0)/M $\nand define a model parameter $\\mathcal Q$ with $0<\\mathcal Q\\leq1$ to be determined by numerical simulations.\nNote that the Pad\\'e approximation is a better approximation than a simple \ntruncated Taylor expansion especially for large relative amplitudes of order unity.\nEq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration} predicts that $A_0/g\\sim \\triangle n/n_0$ for small \namplitudes $|\\triangle n/n_0| < 1$ and $A_0 \\sim g $ for very large amplitudes $\\triangle n /n_0 \\gg 1$, \nwhich confirms the predictions in~\\cite{Pecseli2016} and reproduces the limits discussed in~\\cite{Angus2014}.\n\nAs pointed out earlier for compressible flows Eq.~\\eqref{eq:inequality} can be further estimated\n\\begin{align}\n  (MV)^2  \\leq 4 T_eS(0)^2/m_i. \n  \\label{}\n\\end{align}\nWe therefore have a restriction on the maximum COM velocity for compressible flows, which is absent for incompressible flows\n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{\\max |V|}{\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}} = {\\mathcal Q}\\frac{2S(0)}{M} \\approx \\frac{\\mathcal Q}{2} \\frac{|\\triangle n| }{n_0+2/9 \\triangle n } \\approx \\frac{\\mathcal Q}{2} \\frac{|\\triangle n|}{n_0}.\n  \\label{eq:linear}\n\\end{align}\nFor $|\\triangle n /n_0|< 1$ Eq.~\\eqref{eq:linear} reduces to the linear scaling derived in~\\cite{Kube2016}. \nFinally, a scale analysis of Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vorticity} shows that~\\cite{Ott1978, Garcia2005, Held2016a}\n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{\\max |V|}{\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}} = \\mathcal R \\left( \\frac{\\ell}{R_0}\\frac{|\\triangle n|}{n_0} \\right)^{1/2}.\n  \\label{eq:sqrt}\n\\end{align}\nThis equation predicts a square root dependence of the center of mass velocity \non amplitude and size. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe now propose a simple phenomenological model that captures the essential dynamics\nof blobs and depletions in the previously stated systems. More specifically \nthe model reproduces the acceleration Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration} with and without\nBoussinesq approximation, the square root scaling for the COM velocity \nEq.~\\eqref{eq:sqrt} for incompressible flows as well as the relation between the \nsquare root scaling Eq.~\\eqref{eq:sqrt} and the linear scaling \nEq.~\\eqref{eq:linear} for compressible flows. \nThe basic idea is that the COM of blobs behaves like \nthe one of an infinitely long plasma column immersed in an ambient plasma. \nThe dynamics of this column reduces to the one of a two-dimensional ball.\nThis idea is similar to the analytical ``top hat'' density solution for\nblob dynamics recently studied in~\\cite{Pecseli2016}.\nThe ball is subject to buoyancy as well as linear and nonlinear friction\n\\begin{align}\n  M_{\\text{i}} \\frac{d V}{d t} = (M_{\\text{g}} - M_\\text{p}) g - c_1 V  - \\mathrm{sgn}(V ) \\frac{1}{2}c_2 V^2.\n  \\label{eq:ball}\n\\end{align}\nThe gravity $g$ has a positive sign in the coordinate system; sgn$(f)$ is the sign function. \nThe first term on the right hand side is the buoyancy, where \n$M_{\\text{g}} := \\pi \\ell^2 (n_0 + \\mathcal Q \\triangle n/2)$ \nis the gravitational mass of the ball with radius $\\ell$ and \n$M_\\mathrm{p} := n_0 \\pi \\ell^2 $ \nis the mass of the displaced ambient plasma.\nNote that if $\\triangle n<0$ the ball represents a depletion and the buoyancy term has a negative sign, i.e. the depletion will rise. \nWe introduce an inertial mass \n$M_{\\text{i}} := \\pi\\ell^2 (n_0 +2\\triangle n/9)$ \ndifferent from the gravitational mass $M_{\\text{g}}$ in order to \nrecover the initial acceleration in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration}. \nWe interpret the parameters $\\mathcal Q$ and $2/9$ as geometrical factors \nthat capture the difference of the actual blob form from the idealized\n``top hat'' solution. \nAlso note that the Boussinesq approximation appears in the model as a neglect of inertia, $M_{\\text{i}} = \\pi\\ell^2n_0$.\n\nThe second term is the linear friction term with coefficient $c_1(\\ell)$, which\ndepends on the size of the ball.\nIf we disregard the nonlinear friction, $c_2=0$, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:ball} directly yields a \nmaximum velocity $c_1V^*=\\pi \\ell^2 n g \\mathcal Q\\triangle n/2$.\nFrom our previous considerations $\\max V/\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}=\\mathcal Q \\triangle n /2n_0$, we thus identify \n\\begin{align}\n  c_1 = \\pi\\ell^2 n_0 g/\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}. \n  \\label{}\n\\end{align}\nThe linear friction coefficient thus depends on the gravity and the size of the\nball. \n\nThe last term in \\eqref{eq:ball} is the nonlinear friction. The sign of the force depends on whether\nthe ball rises or falls in the ambient plasma. \nIf we disregard linear friction $c_1=0$, we have the maximum velocity \n$V^*= \\sigma(\\triangle n)\\sqrt{\\pi \\ell^2|\\triangle n| g\\mathcal Q/c_2}$, \nwhich must equal \n$\\max V= \\sigma(\\triangle n) \\mathcal R \\sqrt{g \\ell |\\triangle n/n_0|}$ \nand thus\n\\begin{align}\n  c_2 = {\\mathcal Q\\pi n_0\\ell }/{\\mathcal R^2}.\n  \\label{}\n\\end{align}\nInserting $c_1$ and $c_2$ into Eq.~\\eqref{eq:ball}\nwe can derive the maximum absolute velocity in the form \n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{\\max |V|}{\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}} = \n        \\left(\\frac{\\mathcal R^2}{\\mathcal Q}\\right) \\frac{\\ell}{R_0} \\left( \n        \\left({1+\\left( \\frac{\\mathcal Q}{\\mathcal R} \\right)^{2} \\frac{|\\triangle n|/n_0 }{\\ell/R_0}}\\right)^{1/2}-1 \\right)\n  \\label{eq:vmax_theo}\n\\end{align}\nand thus have a concise expression for $\\max |V|$ that captures both the linear\nscaling \\eqref{eq:linear} as well as the square root scaling \\eqref{eq:sqrt}.\nWith Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration} and Eq.~\\eqref{eq:sqrt} respectively Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vmax_theo} we \nfinally arrive at an analytical expression for the time at which the maximum velocity is reached via \n$t_{\\max V} \\sim \\max V/A_0$. Its inverse $\\gamma:=t_{\\max V}^{-1}$ gives the\nglobal interchange growth rate, for which an empirical expression was\npresented in Reference~\\cite{Held2016a}.\n\n\nWe use the open source library FELTOR \nto simulate \nEqs.~\\eqref{eq:generala} and \\eqref{eq:vorticity} with and without \ndrift compression.\nFor numerical stabilty we added small diffusive terms on the right hand \nsides of the equations.\nThe discontinuous Galerkin methods employ three polynomial coefficients and a minimum of $N_x=N_y=768$ grid cells. The box size is $50\\ell$ in order to mitigate \ninfluences of the finite box size on the blob dynamics. \nMoreover, we used the invariants in Eqs. \\eqref{eq:energya} and \\eqref{eq:energyb} as consistency tests to verify the code and repeated simulations \nalso in a gyrofluid model. \nNo differences to the results presented here were found. \nInitial perturbations on the particle density field are given by Eq.~\\eqref{eq:inita},\nwhere the perturbation amplitude $\\triangle n/n_0$ was chosen between $10^{-3}$ and $20$ for blobs and $-10^0$ and $ -10^{-3}$ for depletions. \nDue to computational reasons we show results only for $\\triangle n/n_0\\leq 20$. \n\n\nFor compressible flows we consider two different cases $\\ell/R_0 = 10^{-2}$ and\n$\\ell /R_0 = 10^{-3}$. \n For incompressible flows Eq.~\\eqref{eq:generala} and \\eqref{eq:vorticity}\n can be normalized such that the blob radius is absent from the equations~\\cite{Ott1978, Kube2012}. \n The simulations of incompressible flows can thus be used for both sizes. \nThe numerical code as well as input parameters and output data can be found \nin the supplemental dataset to this contribution~\\cite{Data2017}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{com_blobs}\n    \\caption{\n      The maximum radial COM velocities of blobs for compressible and incompressible flows are shown. \n      The continuous lines show Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vmax_theo} while the \n      dashed line shows the square root scaling Eq.~\\eqref{eq:sqrt} with \n      $\\mathcal Q = 0.32$ and $\\mathcal R=0.85$.\n    }\n    \\label{fig:com_blobs}\n\\end{figure}\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:com_blobs} we plot the maximum COM velocity for blobs \nwith and without drift compression.\nFor incompressible flows blobs follow the square root scaling almost \nperfectly. Only at very large amplitudes velocities are slightly below\nthe predicted values. \nFor small amplitudes we observe that the compressible blobs follow\na linear scaling. When the amplitudes increase there is a transition to the\nsquare root scaling at around $\\triangle n/n_0 \\simeq 0.5$ for \n$\\ell/R_0=10^{-2}$ and $\\triangle n/n_0 \\simeq 0.05$ for $\\ell/R_0=10^{-3}$, which is consistent with Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vmax_theo} and Reference~\\cite{Kube2016}. \nIn the transition regions the simulated velocities are slightly larger than the predicted ones from Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vmax_theo}.\nBeyond these amplitudes\nthe velocities of compressible and incompressible blobs align. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{com_holes}\n    \\caption{\n      The maximum radial COM velocities of depletions for compressible and incompressible flows are shown. \n      The continuous lines show Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vmax_theo} while the \n      dashed line shows the square root scaling Eq.~\\eqref{eq:sqrt} with \n      $\\mathcal Q = 0.32$ and $\\mathcal R=0.85$.\n      Note that small amplitudes are on the right and amplitudes close to unity are on the left side.\n  }\n    \\label{fig:com_depletions}\n\\end{figure}\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:com_depletions} we show the maximum radial COM velocity \nfor depletions instead of blobs.\nFor relative amplitudes below $|\\triangle n|/n_0 \\simeq 0.5$ (right of unity in the plot) the velocities\ncoincide with the corresponding blob velocities in Fig.~\\ref{fig:com_blobs}. \n For amplitudes larger than $|\\triangle n|/n_0\\simeq 0.5$ the \nvelocities follow the square root scaling.\nWe observe that for plasma depletions beyond $90$ percent the velocities \nin both systems reach a constant value that is very well predicted by the\nsquare root scaling. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{acc_blobs}\n    \\caption{\n      Average acceleration of blobs for compressible and incompressible flows are shown.\n      The continuous line shows the acceleration in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration} \n      with $\\mathcal Q=0.32$\n      while the dashed line is a linear reference line, which corresponds to the Boussinesq approximation. \n  }\n    \\label{fig:acc_blobs}\n\\end{figure}\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:acc_blobs} we show the average acceleration of blobs \nfor compressible and incompressible flows computed\nby dividing the maximum velocity $\\max V$ by the time  \nto reach this velocity $t_{\\max V}$. \nWe compare the simulation results\nto the theoretical predictions Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration} of our model with and without inertia. \nThe results of the compressible and incompressible systems coincide and fit very\nwell to our theoretical values. \nFor amplitudes larger than unity the acceleration deviates significantly from the prediction with Boussinesq approximation.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{acc_holes}\n    \\caption{\n      Average acceleration of depletions for compressible and incompressible flows are shown.\n      The continuous line shows the acceleration in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration} \n      with $\\mathcal Q=0.32$\n      while the dashed line is a linear reference line, which corresponds to the Boussinesq approximation. \n    }\n    \\label{fig:acc_depletions}\n\\end{figure}\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:acc_depletions} we show the simulated acceleration of depletions in the\ncompressible and the incompressible systems. We compare the simulation results\nto the theoretical predictions Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration} of our model with and without inertia.\nDeviations from our theoretical prediction Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration} are visible for amplitudes smaller than $\\triangle n/n_0 \\simeq -0.5$ (left of unity in the plot). The relative deviations are small at around $20$ percent. \nAs in Fig.~\\ref{fig:com_depletions} the acceleration reaches a constant values\nfor plasma depletions of more than $90$ percent.\nComparing Fig.~\\ref{fig:acc_depletions} to Fig.~\\ref{fig:acc_blobs} the asymmetry between blobs and depletions becomes \napparent. While the acceleration of blobs is reduced for large \namplitudes compared to a linear dependence the acceleration \nof depletions is increased. In the language of our simple buoyancy \nmodel the inertia of depletions is reduced but increased for blobs. \n\n\n\nIn conclusion  \n  we discuss the dynamics of seeded blobs and depletions in a \n  compressible and an incompressible system.\n  With only two fit parameters our theoretical results reproduce the \n  numerical COM velocities and accelerations over five orders of magnitude.\n  We derive the amplitude dependence of the acceleration of blobs and depletions from \n  the conservation laws of our systems in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration}. \n  From the same inequality a linear regime is derived in the compressible system for \n  ratios of amplitudes to sizes smaller than a critical value.\n   In this regime \n  the blob and depletion velocity depends linearly on the initial amplitude and \n  is independent of size. The regime is absent from the system with incompressible flows.\n  Our theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations for all \n  amplitudes that are relevant in magnetic fusion devices.\n  Finally, we suggest a new empirical blob model that captures the detailed dynamics of more complicated models. \n  The Boussinesq approximation is clarified as the absence of inertia and a thus altered acceleration of blobs and depletions.\n  The maximum blob velocity is not altered by the Boussinesq approximation.\n\nThe authors were supported with financial subvention from the Research Council of Norway under grant\n240510/F20.
