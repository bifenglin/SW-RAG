    "context": "Time to clean house in Paso Robles Home\nFront Page » Time to clean house in Paso Robles\nSeptember 5, 2010 Opinion By JIM REED\nI’d like to give you an update on the issue of our civil servants cramming hundreds of millions of dollars in spending down our throats after the people of Paso Robles voted down the water rate increase last November. The rate increase is being hung up in the courts by the City Attorney. What was supposed to be a quick issue to get in front of a judge, has been drug out as long as possible by the City Attorney.\nEven if the courts throw out the current rate increase, I expect that our civil servants will just change a couple of words in the rate increase notice and force the same old plan on us again.\nThere is a real problem with the people we have hired to work for us in Paso Robles. It seems that decisions are made based on some agenda, even if it is contrary to citizens’ wishes.\nCity Councilmen Ed Steinbeck, Nick Gilman and Mayor Duane Picanco, on August 19th, voted unanimously to hire the same law firm employed by the City of Bell. You may have heard the recent news story about the City of Bell’s corrupt city representatives.\nThis law firm allowed the elected officials and City employees to pillage the General Fund for their own benefit, contrary to the rights and interests of the citizens. We are already paying several City employees $12,000 per month with equally ridiculous benefits and pensions. What does this say about our elected representatives?\nI believe most residents are like me. We elect people we believe have our best interest in mind. Over the last few years I have seen that nothing is farther from the truth. The people we have elected have lost track of the fact that “the City” exists to protect and deliver services to the citizens. To them it is some all-important ideal they strive to cultivate and improve according to their agenda. They have forgotten that they are elected to represent the citizens.\nWe have an election coming up in November. We have the opportunity to elect some responsible, principled people to represent us. If we elect more people from within this system, we will get more of the same type of government. We need to look at where the new candidates stand. Will they lawfully represent the citizens of the city? Or, are they happy with the way things are being run?\nWe have stood together in the past and have made real significant changes in important matters that are going to affect our lives for years to come. There are several thousand citizens that made their voice heard on the water issue, more than enough votes to make a change in our city government.\nPlease come out and vote for a democratic representative governing body for Paso Robles instead of the tyrannical leadership that exists now.\nJim Reed is a longtime resident of Paso Robles.\nSubjects: Opinion Paso Robles Paso Robles City Council Vote\tRelated:\n<- Previous Next ->\tEndless Summer Nights at Edna Valley, event photos Trial postponed for Paso Robles woman accused of forgery The comments below represent the opinion of the writer and do not represent the views or policies of CalCoastNews.com.

For purposes of subdivision (a) of Section\n65583, the share of a city or county of the regional housing need\nshall include that share of the housing need of persons at all income\nlevels within the area significantly affected by the general plan of\n(2) While it is the intent of the Legislature that cities,\ncounties, and cities and counties should undertake all necessary\nactions to encourage, promote, and facilitate the development of\nhousing to accommodate the entire regional housing need, it is\nrecognized, however, that future housing production may not equal the\nregional housing need established for planning purposes.\n(b) The department, in consultation with each council of\ngovernments, shall determine each region’s existing and projected\nhousing need pursuant to Section 65584.01 at least two years prior to\nthe scheduled revision required pursuant to Section 65588. The\nappropriate council of governments, or for cities and counties\nwithout a council of governments, the department, shall adopt a final\nregional housing need plan that allocates a share of the regional\nhousing need to each city, county, or city and county at least one\nyear prior to the scheduled revision for the region required by\nSection 65588. The allocation plan prepared by a council of\ngovernments shall be prepared pursuant to Sections 65584.04 and\n65584.05 with the advice of the department.\n(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the due dates for\nthe determinations of the department or for the council of\ngovernments, respectively, regarding the regional housing need may be\nextended by the department by not more than 60 days if the extension\nwill enable access to more recent critical population or housing\ndata from a pending or recent release of the United States Census\nBureau or the Department of Finance. If the due date for the\ndetermination of the department or the council of governments is\nextended for this reason, the department shall extend the\ncorresponding housing element revision deadline pursuant to Section\n65588 by not more than 60 days.\n(d) The regional housing needs allocation plan shall be consistent\nwith all of the following objectives:\n(1) Increasing the housing supply and the mix of housing types,\ntenure, and affordability in all cities and counties within the\nregion in an equitable manner, which shall result in each\njurisdiction receiving an allocation of units for low- and very low\n(2) Promoting infill development and socioeconomic equity, the\nprotection of environmental and agricultural resources, and the\nencouragement of efficient development patterns.\n(3) Promoting an improved intraregional relationship between jobs\n(4) Allocating a lower proportion of housing need to an income\ncategory when a jurisdiction already has a disproportionately high\nshare of households in that income category, as compared to the\ncountywide distribution of households in that category from the most\nrecent decennial United States census.\n(e) For purposes of this section, “household income levels” are as\ndetermined by the department as of the most recent decennial census\npursuant to the following code sections:\n(1) Very low incomes as defined by Section 50105 of the Health and\n(2) Lower incomes, as defined by Section 50079.5 of the Health and\n(3) Moderate incomes, as defined by Section 50093 of the Health\nand Safety Code.\n(4) Above moderate incomes are those exceeding the moderate-income\nlevel of Section 50093 of the Health and Safety Code.\n(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, determinations\nmade by the department, a council of governments, or a city or county\npursuant to this section or Section 65584.01, 65584.02, 65584.03,\n65584.04, 65584.05, 65584.06, 65584.07, or 65584.08 are exempt from\nthe California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing\nwith Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).\npasoobserver says:\t09/13/2010 at 6:52 pm\nTo whatisup —- First of all, I reviewed AB 602 Assembly Bill. Thanks. I am sorry to inform you but AB 602 is not the LAW as you so stated in your blog. I contacted the Deputy Chief Council’s office in Sacramento handling AB 602 to confirm your misstatement of facts. You know,in the English language, It shouldn’t be so difficult to answer some simple questions with a “YES” or “NO” answer. Yet, you are reluctant to do so, but you go on and on with a thesis along with some rhetoric. I never talked about a court suit over the “water issue”, I asked YOU, not about waiting for a court decision. Maybe, you did with some other people. Also, I was not ranting about the wineries usage of water. My response to you on your vague question about “there are people not paying their fair share for their use of water”. I related, are you talking about the wineries? I am well aware that most of the wineries are outside the city limits using the same aquifer. You took my question out of context., nice try! You are just being a popinjay and rhetorical. Also, you didn’t answer another question about “what is the unit cost of water” in Templeton? as compared to Paso Robles.\nwhatisup says:\t09/13/2010 at 8:54 pm\nI am on a well. I am sure you are capable of doing your own homework. I also am quite sure if you really contacted the Deputy Chief Counsel’s Office you have been set straight. What I gave you is a proposed small adjustment in the wide range of laws that make up the California Housing element. I assumed you could stumble onto the facts based on what I gave you. By the way, I believe you can review the Paso Robles Housing element plan on the City’s website or at the Library. The California Housing Element Laws that all cities and counties have to follow have been in place for almost 25 years. I realize you don’t actually have a clue how to look the laws up. Either educate yourself or keep making a fool of yourself, your choice. A simple Google search of California Housing Element Laws will get you going. Good Luck!\nTO WHATISUP — I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT LAW YOU ARE REFERRING TO THAT SAYS “WE” THE PEOPLE HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE NEW DEVELOPMENT? AGAIN, FOR THE THIRD TIME, YOU FAILED TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS POSED TO YOU IN MY PRIOR RESPONSES TO YOU ON SEPT.10TH &11TH. IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU DON’T WANT TO ANSWER THEM? YOU DO WHAT OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS DO SO WELL, AND THAT IS “IN ONE EAR AND OUT OF THE OTHER EAR” IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU ARE EITHER EMPLOYED BY THE CITY OR YOU HAVE OTHER DEALING WITH THE CITY, SO BE IT. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT YOU THINK THE CITY DOES EVERYTHING RIGHT. APPARENTLY, YOU PRESENT YOURSELF AS BEING VERY BIAS ON CITY DECISIONS. IT LIKE THEY CAN’T DO ANYTHING WRONG ACCORDING TO YOUR LOGIC. THEY KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR THE CITIZENS OF PASO,THAT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF ARROGANCE ALONG WITH NARCISSISM.\nWHAT PEOPLE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT DOESN’T PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF WATER? ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE WINERIES USING THE SAME AQUIFER?\nI BELIEVE YOU RELATED THAT YOU RESIDE IN TEMPLETON, BUT YOU OWN PROPERTY IN PASO. BY THE WAY, WHAT IS THE COST PER UNIT OF WATER USAGE IN TEMPLETON COMPARED TO PASO? OF COURSE, TEMPLETON IS IN AN UNINCORPORATED AREA (COUNTY JURISDICTION).\nWELL, I GAVE YOU SOME SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO PAY FOR THE NACIMIENTO WATER PIPELINE AND SEWER TREATMENT PLANT. ALSO, REMEMBER IT’S THE CITIZENS’ MONEY THAT IS BEING SPENT. WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, IS LET THE CITIZENS OF PASO DECIDE WITH THEIR VOTE ON HOW TO FINANCE THIS HUGE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT EXPENDITURE. JUST BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE PROPOSITION 218 AND STOP CIRCUMVENTING THE LAW.\nWOULD YOU OBJECT TO HAVING TO FINANCE SOME NEW BONDS ON YOUR PROPERTY TAX BILL AS A ” SPECIAL TAX” OR AN ASSESSMENT TAX” TO PAY FOR THE NACIMIENTO WATER PIPELINE AND SEWER TREATMENT PLANT? A PERCENTAGE OF PASO CITIZENS FINANCE LOCAL SCHOOL BONDS ON THEIR PROPERTY TAX BILL AND DON’T HAVE ANY KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL. HOW ABOUT THAT COMPARISON FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT? WHAT SAY YOU?\nI say less CapsLock, please.\nwhatisup says:\t09/12/2010 at 11:41 pm\nI have answered your questions. I have been quite detailed in my answers and I am sorry if you can’t deal with the detail. I guess it is your inconvenient truth. You do seem to like to deflect and go around in circles. Another example, now you are ranting about the wineries using the same aquaifier as the City. Let me be clear for you, I don’t like the amount of water the wineries are using. However, the wineries are in the County, not in the City and the City can’t do anything about it. They wineries are allowed to take the water they are taking even if it drops the City’s water levels in their wells. You need to complain to Sacramento. It sounds like you just don’t want to pay anything for the infrastructure because you really just don’t want it built.\nSeveral of your observations of my opinions are bizarre considering I have stated several times I believe the Courts need to decide if Paso Robles has, or has not followed the rules as to funding the infrastucture. Obviously, as I have stated before, if the City loses the lawsuit the infrastructure will have to be paid out of the City’s General Fund until a new method of payment is voted on by the Citizens of Paso Robles. Pretty clear.\nYour idea of charging based on a special assesment rather than the amount of water a property uses means that people who use little water, but live on a more expensive property will pay more than their share, based on their water usage. In addition, how do you deal with a rental unit where the renter is supposed to pay the water bill? Your idea is inherantly unfair, but my guess is it will favor you, so you don’t care if it is unfair and other people would pay part of your share. You also have decided that since I have alternative ideas to yours I must work for, or have business with the City of Paso Robles, another attempt to deflect from the issue. However, once again, I have never worked for the City or have ever done business with the City and don’t expect to ever do business with the City. I do own property in the City which is why I pay attention. Finally, it turns out there needs to be a fix to the housing element laws, the existance of which you are questioning. As I understand it the fix to the housing elemnt laws is because of some lawsuit. This should give you all the information you need to educate yourself on the California Housing Element laws that every city and county in California has to follow:\nBILL ANALYSIS ————————————————————\n|SENATE RULES COMMITTEE | AB 602|\n|Office of Senate Floor Analyses | |\n|1020 N Street, Suite 524 | |\n|(916) 651-1520 Fax: (916) | |\n|327-4478 | |\n———————————————————— THIRD READING\nBill No: AB 602\nAuthor: Feuer (D), et al\nAmended: 8/20/10 in Senate\nSENATE TRANSPORTATION & HOUSING COMM : 6-3, 6/29/10\nAYES: Lowenthal, DeSaulnier, Kehoe, Pavley, Simitian, Wolk\nNOES: Huff, Ashburn, Harman\nASSEMBLY FLOOR : Not relevant\nSUBJECT : Statute of limitations on housing element\nSOURCE : California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation\nHousing California DIGEST : This bill states the intent of the Legislature\nin enacting this bill to modify the courts opinion in Urban\nHabitat Program v. City of Pleasanton (2008) 164\nCal.App.4th 1561, with respect to the interpretation of\nSection 65009 of the Government Code, and revises and\nclarifies statute of limitations and remedies for specified\nhousing related challenges.\nSenate Floor Amendments of 8/20/10 revise the statute of\nlimitations and remedies for specified housing-related\nANALYSIS : The Planning and Zoning Law requires cities\nand counties to prepare and adopt a general plan, including\na housing element, to guide the future growth of a\ncommunity. Following a staggered statutory schedule,\ncities and counties located within the territory of a\nmetropolitan planning organization (MPO) must revise their\nhousing elements every eight years, and cities and counties\nin rural non-MPO regions must revise their housing elements\nevery five years. These five- and eight-year periods are\nknown as the housing element planning period.\nBefore each revision, each community is assigned its fair\nshare of housing for each income category through the\nregional housing needs assessment (RHNA) process. A\nhousing element must identify and analyze existing and\nprojected housing needs, identify adequate sites with\nappropriate zoning to meet its share of the RHNA, and\nensure that regulatory systems provide opportunities for,\nand do not unduly constrain, housing development. The\nreviews both draft and adopted housing elements to\ndetermine whether or not they are in substantial compliance\nwith the law. The Planning and Zoning Law and the Subdivision Map Act\nalso includes a number of sections governing zoning and\nentitlements specifically related to housing, including:\n? The Housing Accountability Act, which requires a city or\ncounty to make one or more specified findings in order to\ndisapprove a particular housing development.\n? A provision requiring cities and counties, when adopting\nan ordinance which limits the number of housing units\nwhich may be constructed on an annual basis, to make\nfindings as to the public health, safety, and welfare\nbenefits that justify reducing the housing opportunities\nof the region. ? Density bonus law, which requires cities and counties to\ngrant a developer a density bonus, incentives, and\nconcessions when the developer proposes to include\nspecified percentages of affordable housing within a\ndevelopment. ? The Least Cost Zoning Law, which requires cities and AB 602\ncounties to designate and zone sufficient vacant land for\nresidential use with appropriate standards to meet\nhousing needs for all income categories and to contribute\nto producing housing at the lowest possible cost.\n? A requirement that, when determining whether to approve a\ntentative subdivision map, a city or county shall apply\nonly those ordinances, policies, and standards in effect\nas of the date the developer’s application is deemed\nPrior to a recent court decision, it was understood that\ncurrent law allowed a party to challenge the adequacy of a\ncity’s or county’s housing element at any time during a\nplanning period, provided that the challenger brought the\naction “in support of or to encourage or facilitate the\ndevelopment of housing that would increase the community’s\nsupply of [affordable] housing.” The challenging party was\nrequired first to serve the city or county with a notice\nidentifying the deficiencies in the housing element. After\n60 days or the date on which the city or county took final\naction in response to the notice, whichever occurred first,\nthe challenging party had one year to file the action in\ncourt. This process and statute of limitations also\napplied to actions brought pursuant to the housing-related\nstatutes listed above. In 2006 Urban Habitat Program brought suit to challenge the\nCity of Pleasanton’s housing policies, including the city’s\nannual cap on housing permits and the city’s cap on the\naggregate number of permissible housing units, both of\nwhich Urban Habitat claimed were insufficient to allow the\ncity to meet its RHNA obligation. In 2008, the First\nDistrict California Court of Appeals issued an unpublished\ndecision in the case of Urban Habitat Program v. City of\nPleasanton allowing the case to proceed with respect to\nsome causes of action, but ruling that the challenge to the\nhousing element itself was time-barred. The court stated:\nAlthough the statute does not specify the time within\nwhich [a deficiency] notice must be given, it is our\nconclusion that the statute must be interpreted as\ncontaining a time limit within which this requirement\nmust be met? In sum, a party bringing a challenge AB 602\ngoverned by section 65009, subdivision (d), has 90\ndays from the date a legislative action is taken or\napproval is given to notify the local land use\nauthority of any claimed deficiencies in such an\naction or approval. Its claim then accrues 60 days\nafter it gives this notice.\nIn other words, instead of being able to initiate a\nchallenge to a deficient housing element at any time during\nthe planning period, housing advocates and other interested\nparties may now only initiate such a challenge by\nsubmitting a deficiency notice within 90 days of the\nhousing element’s adoption.\n1.Removes from the current list of city or county actions\nwhich may be challenged pursuant to Government Code 65009\nnotice and accrual provisions those actions related to\nthe Housing Accountability Act, the Subdivision Map Act,\nand the application of a Density Bonus ordinance to a\nparticular project, all of which are project-specific\nactions. The bill maintains the ability to use these\nnotice and accrual provisions to challenge the adequacy\nof a city’s or county’s density bonus ordinance\n2.Extends lengthening the time in which a deficiency notice\nmay be served to cover all remaining city or county\nactions described in this section of law, as opposed to\njust housing element challenges. In other words, the\namendments apply the longer timeframe to serve the\ndeficiency notice to actions relating to the Least Cost\nZoning Law, annual limits on housing permits, and the\nadequacy of a density bonus ordinance, in addition to\nhousing element law. 3.Provides that an entity challenging such an action in\nsupport of affordable housing may serve the deficiency\nnotice up to five years after the city’s or county’s\naction. After 60 days or the date on which the city or\ncounty takes final action in response to the notice,\nwhichever occurs first, the challenging party has one\nyear to file an action in court, except that the lawsuit AB 602\nmay not be filed more than five years after the city’s or\ncounty’s action. In other words, the entity must file\nthe lawsuit within one year of the expiration of the\ndeficiency notice or within five years of the city’s or\ncounty’s action, whichever occurs first.\n4.Provides that a housing element from a prior planning\nperiod may not be challenged if the city or county has\nadopted a revised housing element for the new planning\nGovernment Code 65755 . Current law requires a court, if it\nfinds any portion of a general plan, including a housing\nelement, out of compliance with the law, to include within\nits order or judgment one or more of the following remedies\nfor any or all types of developments or any or all\ngeographic segments of the city or county until the city or\ncounty has complied with the law:\n? Suspend the authority of the city or county to\nissue building permits.\ngrant zoning changes and/or variances.\ngrant subdivision map approvals.\n? Mandate the approval of building permits for\nresidential housing that meet specified criteria.\n? Mandate the approval of final subdivision maps for\nhousing projects that meet specified criteria.\n? Mandate the approval of tentative subdivision maps\nfor residential housing projects that meet specified\nThis bill clarifies that in any action or proceeding\nbrought pursuant to the notice and accrual provisions of\nGovernment Code Section 65009 described above, neither the\ncourt remedies described above nor any injunction against\nthe development of a housing project shall abrogate,\nimpair, or otherwise interfere with the full exercise of\nthe rights and protections granted to an applicant for a\ntentative map or a vesting tentative map under specified\nprovisions of the Subdivision Map Act or to a developer\nunder a specified provision relating to development AB 602\nUnder current law, HCD operates a number of grant programs\nto which cities and counties may apply. In many cases, the\nlaw requires a city or county to have an HCD-approved\nhousing element in order to be eligible for funding. This bill provides that if a third-party challenges the\nadequacy of a housing element in court and the court finds\nthat the housing element substantially complies with all of\nthe requirements of housing element law, the element shall\nbe deemed to be in compliance for purposes of state housing\nThe statutory language interpreted by the court and at\nissue in this bill was added to statute by AB 998 (Waters),\nChapter 1138, Statutes of 1983, a bill sponsored by the\nLeague of California Cities and the California Building\nIndustry Association. AB 998 created a short statute of\nlimitations period for land use decisions generally but\nprovided a specific exception to protect the ability to\nchallenge deficient housing elements. The Senate Housing\nand Land Use Committee and the Senate Third Reading\nanalysis of the bill stated that the bill:\nSpecifies that for challenges in support of low- and\nmoderate-income housing requirements, the petitioner\nshall notice local government 60 days prior to filing\naction. The [one-year] statute of limitations then\nbegins on the first day the legislative body fails to\nIn the intervening 25 years prior to the Urban Habitat\nruling, housing advocates filed and successfully settled at\nleast ten cases in which the 60-day deficiency notice was\nsent more than 90 days after adoption of the city’s or\ncounty’s housing element. In none of these cases was the\ntimeliness on the advocates’ suit contested. Likewise, six\nbills amended other portions of this statute during those\nintervening years, and there was never any controversy\nsurrounding the lack of a deadline for housing advocates to\nserve a deficiency notice nor any attempt to change the AB 602\nstatute in this regard. Current level of housing element compliance . According to\nHCD’s website as of June 7, 2010, only 46 percent of cities\nand counties have adopted an HCD-approved housing element\nfor the current planning period that began in 2005 for the\nSan Diego region, 2008 for the Southern California, Fresno,\nKern, and Sacramento regions, and the summer of 2009 for\nthe remaining areas of the state. Unlocking the private market . The purpose of housing\nelement law is to create opportunities for the private\nhousing market to function. Builders cannot build without\naccess to appropriately zoned land, and current land use\nplans in many cities and counties in California fail to\nprovide sufficient opportunities to accommodate projected\npopulation growth. The San Diego Association of\nGovernments’ Regional Comprehensive Plan describes this\ntypical California paradox in the following way:\nUnder current plans and policies, more than 90 percent\nof [the San Diego region’s] remaining vacant land\ndesignated for housing is planned for densities of\nless than one home per acre, and most is in the rural\nback country areas dependent upon scarce groundwater\nsupplies. And of the remaining vacant land planned for\nhousing in the 18 incorporated cities, only about\nseven percent is planned for multifamily housing. When\ntaken together, the current land use plans of the 19\nlocal jurisdictions do not accommodate the amount of\ngrowth anticipated in our region. SANDAG’s population\nforecast, which reflects the current adopted local\nland use plans in the region, projects that while\npopulation will increase by 37 percent by 2030,\nhousing will grow by just 30 percent. The forecast\nshows that if local plans are not changed, demand for\nhousing will continue to outpace the supply, just as\nHousing element law addresses this problem directly by\nrequiring cities and counties to zone land at appropriate\ndensities to accommodate the projected housing needs of all\nincome groups and to remove constraints that prevent such\nsites from being developed at the allowed densities. AB 602\nCities and counties, however, are not required to build\nhousing because that is the role of private developers.\nThe law holds cities and counties accountable only for that\nwhich they control: zoning and land use entitlements.\nWithout the ability to enforce housing element law, the\nmarket’s ability to meet housing demand may well remain\nlocked up.\nFISCAL EFFECT : Appropriation: No Fiscal Com.: No\nSUPPORT : (Verified 8/23/10)\nCalifornia Rural Legal Assistance Foundation (co-source)\nHousing California (co-source)\nAdvocates for Affordable Homes in Fremont\nCalifornia Coalition for Rural Housing\nCommunity Housing Improvement Program\nCommunity Housing Works\nEden Housing\nFair Housing of Marin\nGrassroots Leadership Network of Marin\nKennedy Commission\nPublic Advocates, Inc\nSan Diego Housing Federation\nSelf-Help Enterprises\nSierra Club of California\nAmerican Planning Association, California Chapter\nJA:nl 8/23/10 Senate Floor Analyses SUPPORT/OPPOSITION: SEE ABOVE\npasoobserver says:\t09/11/2010 at 11:17 pm\nTo whatisup — Thank you for your response to my comments. However, you failed to answer some of my questions that I mentioned to you. It’s almost like dealing with some City officials. They just let the public vent at their bimonthly council meetings. In my opinion, it’s difficult to deal with narcissism and arrogance. Over the years, there has been some very good input to our elected officials on how to proceed on the Nacimiento water pipeline,but it fell on deaf ears. You wanted me to answer some of your questions,but you did not answer some of my questions. Again, are you willing to subsidize new development?,Yes?or No?, are you willing to pay for a commodity that you are not receiving? Yes?or No? and another question for you. Are you willing to pay over 300% on your water bills within the five (5) year plan that the City has proposed? Also, the water rates will be subject to later increases too. By the way, I do concur with the city’s plan of “you pay for the amount of water units you use”. (748 gal=one unit). However, the higher water rates are not good for our senior citizens on fixed incomes and other struggling families in our community. My first suggestion years ago was desalination. The response was it was too expensive. Of course, now it is more expensive. I would suggest that our elected officials recall the existing bonds (The bonds can be recalled early). The City council can explain to the citizens in detail with financing of new bonds at a lower interest rate as of now for the sewer plant and Nacimiento water pipeline and present their new proposal in compliance with Proposition 218. Let the citizens of Paso VOTE on the financing bonds for their approval. Most of the citizens,that I had spoken to were not happy with the way our City Council handled the Nacimiento water pipeline project. The citizens of Paso didn’t give our City Council a “BLANK CHECK” for $176 million to spend without voter approval. I would suggest that it be a “special tax” or “an assessment” be levied on our property taxes. A percentage of those bonds can be deducted on Federal Income taxes. As it is now, a” fee” on a capital funding project is not deductible. Of course, there are homeowners would not go for this suggestion due to our poor economy. My analogy mentioned above would be, you would get something back on a “special tax” or an “assessment” verses nothing on a “fee”. What say you?\nwhatisup says:\t09/12/2010 at 9:02 am\nUnfortunately the law says we have to subsidize new development in California. I don’t like it, but it is the law. I know paying using the property taxes was bandied about. The argument against it was it would mean some would be paying for water they aren’t using and others could be big water users, but pay a small special assessment on their property taxes. I think the decision that was made to base it on usage was out of fairness. It seems to me if people are using water and not paying their share of the costs it is not fair. The Senior issue is very difficult. If someone is retired for twenty years is it realistic to think prices don’t go up during the 20 years of retirement. Think what prices were in 1990 compared to today. Should Seniors never have to pay for capital improvements? Paso Robles also had very low water rates. Rates that are no longer possible given the circumstances. Desalination will happen eventually. California is out of water. If you want to pay $1,000,000 a gallon there is no more allotable water of any consequence in California. The expense will be tremendous — still have to build a desalination plant, still have to build a pipeline. I don’t know if the plant has to be built along the ocean or if the salt water could be piped over to Paso Robles. If it has to be built along the ocean, Paso Robles doesn’t own land on the ocean and, in any case, the environmentalists will keep it in courts for years as they have done so for other proposed desalination plants in Southern California. Eventually necessity will force desalination past the environmentalists, but not yet.\npasojim says:\t09/13/2010 at 7:46 am\nWhatisup – On one of your previous post you made the comment you haven’t heard any of the legal suggestions for the water issue, But you obviously have. That is a good thing. So we can move the discussion ahead.\nOnce, again this was handled incorrectly by our city custodians from the beginning. And now here we are. The public is not supporting this very expensive, very limited benefit project. As you said, until a plan is developed that the public can support, things don’t look good.\nAll this discussion about the water issue has only reinforced my opinion the issue hasn’t been about water, only how the plan should be paid for. Or more specifically, to what extent do we allow our elected custodians and our un-elected GOD tzar decide which laws they will follow and which laws they will ignore. When the City GOD tzar tell citizens at a council meeting if we don’t agree with the City’s plan, then we should just sue him, and when the City Attorney explains to a citizen at a City Council meeting that she does have to respond to their questions because she does NOT work for them. When the project is voted down by the citizens and the council brings it right back up, it is clear that our elected representatives are not doing their job providing direction to their employees and listening to and representing the CITIZENS.\nThe subject of the original post was the need to elect different representation.
