    "context": "\\section{Introduction}\nThe averaged quantities can be obtained in two different ways in\nmagnetohydrodynamics. The first way is to solve 3D MHD equations\nand then average the results. The second way is to solve some\nsystem of equations on averages. Combination of numerical\nsimulations and averaged theory brings phenomenology that can\ndescribe observations or experimental data.\n\nThe problem of spherically symmetric accretion takes its origin\nfrom Bondi's work \\citep{bondi}. He presented idealized\nhydrodynamic solution with accretion rate $\\dot{M}_B.$ However,\nmagnetic field $\\vec{B}$ always exists in the real systems. Even\nsmall seed $\\vec{B}$ amplifies in spherical infall and becomes\ndynamically important \\citep{schwa}.\n\nMagnetic field inhibits accretion \\citep{schwa}. None of many\ntheories has reasonably calculated the magnetic field evolution\nand how it influences dynamics. These theories have some common\npitfalls. First of all, the direction of magnetic field is usually\ndefined. Secondly, the magnetic field strength is prescribed by\nthermal equipartition assumption. In third, dynamical effect of\nmagnetic field is calculated with conventional magnetic energy and\npressure. All these inaccuracies can be eliminated.\n\nIn Section 2\\ref{section_method} I develop a model that abandons\nequipartition prescription, calculates the magnetic field\ndirection and strength and employs the correct equations of\nmagnetized fluid dynamics. In Section 3\\ref{results} I show this\naccretion pattern to be in qualitative agreement with Sgr A*\nspectrum models. I discuss my assumptions in Section 4\n\\ref{discussion}.\n\n\\section{Analytical method}\\label{section_method}\n Reasonable turbulence evolution model is the key difference of my\n method. I build an averaged turbulence theory that corresponds to\nnumerical simulations. I start with the model of isotropic\nturbulence that is consistent with simulations of collisional MHD\nin three regimes. Those regimes are decaying hydrodynamic\nturbulence, decaying MHD turbulence and dynamo action. I introduce\neffective isotropization of magnetic field in 3D model.\nIsotropization is taken to have a timescale of the order of\ndissipation timescale that is a fraction $\\gamma\\sim1$ of the\nAlfven wave crossing time $\\tau_{\\rm diss}=\\gamma r/v_A.$\n\nCommon misconception exists about the dynamical influence of\nmagnetic field. Neither magnetic energy nor magnetic pressure can\nrepresent $\\vec{B}$ in dynamics. Correct averaged Euler and energy\nequations were derived in \\citep{scharlemann} for radial magnetic\nfield. Magnetic force $\\vec{F}_M=[\\vec{j}\\times\\vec{B}]$ can be\naveraged over the solid angle with proper combination of\n$\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{B}=0.$ I extend the derivation to random\nmagnetic field without preferred direction. Dynamical effect of\nmagnetic helicity \\citep{biskamp03} is also investigated. I\nneglect radiative and mechanical transport processes.\n\nThe derived set of equations requires some modifications and\nboundary conditions to be applicable to the real astrophysical\nsystems. I add external energy input to turbulence to balance\ndissipative processes in the outer flow. The outer turbulence is\ntaken to be isotropic and has magnetization $\\sigma\\sim1.$\nTransonic smooth solution is chosen as possessing the highest\naccretion rate as in \\citep{bondi}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\\label{fig1}\n  \\includegraphics[height=.5\\textheight]{velocities}\n  \\caption{Normalized to Keplerian speed characteristic velocities of magnetized flow. Horizontal lines correspond to self-similar solution $v\\sim r^{-1/2}.$}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Results \\& Application to Sgr A*}\\label{results}\n\n\\begin{figure}\\label{fig2}\n  \\includegraphics[height=.5\\textheight]{magnetization}\n  \\caption{Plot of magnetization $\\sigma=(E_M+E_K)/E_{Th}$ with radius.}\n\\end{figure}\nThe results of my calculations confirm some known facts about\nspherical magnetized accretion, agree with the results of\nnumerical simulations and have some previously unidentified\nfeatures.\n\nInitially isotropic magnetic field exhibits strong anisotropy with\nlarger radial field $B_r.$ Perpendicular magnetic field\n$B_\\perp\\ll B_r$ is dynamically unimportant in the inner accretion\nregion Fig\\ref{fig1}. Because magnetic field dissipates, infall\nonto the black hole can proceed \\citep{schwa}.\n\nTurbulence is supported by external driving in the outer flow\nregions, but internal driving due to freezing-in amplification\ntakes over in the inner flow Fig\\ref{fig2}. Magnetization of the\nflow increases in the inner region with decreasing radius\nconsistently with simulations \\cite{igumen06}. Density profile\nappears to be $\\rho\\sim r^{-1.25}$ that is different from\ntraditional ADAF scaling $\\rho\\sim r^{-1.5}$ \\citep{narayan}. Thus\nthe idea of self-similar behavior is not supported.\n\nCompared to non-magnetized accretion, infall rate is 2-5 times\nsmaller depending on outer magnetization. In turn, gas density is\n2-5 times smaller in the region close to the black hole, where\nsynchrotron radiation emerges \\citep{narayan}. Sgr A* produces\nrelatively weak synchrotron \\citep{narayan}. So, either gas\ndensity $n$ or electron temperature $T_e$ or magnetic field $B$\nare small in the inner flow or combination of factors works. Thus\nlow gas density in magnetized model is in qualitative agreement\nwith the results of modelling the spectrum.\n\nFlow is convectively stable on average in the model of moving\nblobs, where dissipation heat is released homogeneously in volume.\nMoving blobs are in radial and perpendicular pressure\nequilibriums. They are governed by the same equations as the\nmedium.\n\n\\section{Discussion \\& Conclusion}\\label{discussion}\nThe presented accretion study self-consistently treats turbulence\nin the averaged model. This model introduces many weak assumptions\ninstead of few strong ones.\n\nI take dissipation rate to be that of collisional MHD simulations.\nBut flow in question is rather in collisionless regime.\nObservations of collisionless flares in solar corona\n\\citep{noglik} gives dissipation rate $20$ times smaller than in\ncollisional simulations \\citep{biskamp03}. However, flares in\nsolar corona may represent a large-scale reconnection event rather\nthan developed turbulence. It is unclear which dissipation rate is\nmore realistic for accretion.\n\nMagnetic field presents another caveat. Magnetic field lines\nshould close, or $\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{B}=0$ should hold. Radial\nfield is much larger than perpendicular in the inner region.\nTherefore, characteristic radial scale of the flow is much larger\nthan perpendicular. If radial turbulence scale is larger than\nradius, freezing-in condition does not hold anymore. Matter can\nfreely slip along radial field lines into the black hole. If\nmatter slips already at the sonic point, the accretion rate should\nbe higher than calculated.\n\nSome other assumptions are more likely to be valid. Diffusion\nshould be weak because of high Mach number that approaches unity\nat large radius. Magnetic helicity was found to play very small\ndynamical role. Only when the initial turbulence is highly\nhelical, magnetic helicity conservation may lead to smaller\naccretion rate. Neglect of radiative cooling is justified a\nposteriori. Line cooling time is about $20$ times larger that\ninflow time from outer boundary.\n\nThe study is the extension of basic theory, but realistic\nanalytical models should include more physics. The work is\nunderway.\n\\begin{theacknowledgments}\nI thank my advisor Prof. Ramesh Narayan for fruitful discussions.\n\\end{theacknowledgments}\n\n\\bibliographystyle{aipproc}\n\n",
