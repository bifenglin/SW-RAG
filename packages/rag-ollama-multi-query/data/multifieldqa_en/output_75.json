The soft band (0.2$-$2 keV) sensitivity limit of the slews\n(6$\\times10^{-13}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) is close to that of the\nROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS; Voges et al.\\ 1999), and in the medium\n(2$-$12 keV) band, the slew data goes significantly deeper\n(4$\\times10^{-12}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) than all other previous\nlarge area surveys. Over 7700 individual sources have so far been\ndetected to a positional accuracy of 8\\arcsec.  For details on the\nthe construction and\ncharacteristics of the first released XMM-Newton slew survey\ncatalogue, see Saxton et al. (2008). For details of the initial\nscience results from the slew survey, see Read et al. (2006).\n\nThe comparison of XMM-Newton slew data with the RASS is now giving,\nfor the first time, the opportunity to find exotic, extreme\nhigh-variability X-ray bursting objects, e.g. tidal disruption\ncandidates (Esquej et al. 2007), and also Galactic novae, flare stars,\nand flaring white dwarfs, plus eclipsing binaries, AGN and blazars. It\nis only with such a large-area survey as the XMM-Newton Slew Survey,\nthat transient events as these have a chance of being caught.\n\nOne such rare event, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, which we here show to be\na new Classical Nova, was discovered in an XMM-Newton slew from 18th\nJuly 2006 at a very high count rate of 23.3\\,ct s$^{-1}$ (EPIC-pn:\n0.2$-$2\\,keV). \n\nClassical novae (see Bode \\& Evans 2008 for a review) occur in\ninteracting binary systems consisting of a white dwarf primary star\nand a lower-mass secondary star. The nova itself is a cataclysmic\nnuclear explosion caused by the accretion of material (via Roche Lobe\noverflow or wind accretion) from the secondary star onto the surface\nof the white dwarf; here the pressure and temperature at the base of\nthe accreted material becomes sufficient to trigger a thermonuclear\nrunaway. A recent review of the thermonuclear processes powering\nclassical novae can be found in Starrfield et al.\\ (2008).  The\naccreted material is partially expelled, obscuring the X-ray emission\nfrom the surface of the white dwarf. At later stages, the ejected\nmaterial expands further and becomes optically thin, revealing the\nnuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf.  This emission\npeaks in the soft X-ray regime and it is known as the super-soft\nsource (SSS) state (Krautter 2008). Models of the classical nova SSS\nstate can be found in Tuchman \\& Truran (1998) and Sala \\& Hernanz\n(2005).\n\nThough many classical novae have been observed in X-rays in their SSS\nstates (Ness et al.\\ (2007) for example discuss several examples observed with\nSwift), it is in the optical band, early in their outbursts, that\nclassical novae are almost always discovered. This is because they are\nintrinsically optically bright and easily found in inexpensive\nwide-area shallow surveys.  XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is very unusual\ntherefore in that it has been discovered, as we shall see, later in\nits evolution, in the SSS X-ray state.\n\nIn this paper we describe the XMM-Newton slew observations\n(Section~2), and the follow-up X-ray observations by the Swift XRT\n(Section~3) and XMM-Newton (Section~4). Multiwavelength observations\nwith Swift-UVOT, Magellan and ASAS are described in Section~5. We then\npresent a discussion of the results (Section~6), and conclusions.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n  \\caption[]\n  {Details of the four XMM-Newton Slew observations and the single (Rev.\\,1378) \n    dedicated XMM-Newton pointed observation.

Details of the standard\nXMM-Newton slew data reduction and analysis used, plus the\nsource-searching and catalogue cross-correlation etc., are presented\nin Saxton et al.  (2008).\n\nThe source passed through the EPIC-pn detector in 14\\,s, at a small\noff-axis angle, such that an effective vignetting-corrected soft band\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) exposure time of 9.8\\,s was achieved.  A total of 229\nsource counts lie within a radius of 20\\arcsec, yielding a (EPIC-pn:\n0.2$-$2\\,keV) count rate of 23.4\\,ct s$^{-1}$.\n\nThe source is seen to have no cross-correlation identifications in the\nRASS, and no other multiwavelength candidates within 30\\arcsec\\ in\nSimbad\\footnote{http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/},\nNED\\footnote{http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html}, and\nHEASARC\\footnote{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/}. The position of the\nsource in the sky is such that it lies apparently at the outer eastern\nedge of the LMC.\n\nXMM-Newton has slewed over this region of sky a number of times, and\nthough nothing was detected in previous slews from 7th November 2001\nand 12th January 2004, the source was seen again on 28th September\n2006 (rev.\\,1246, 72 days after the rev.\\,1210 discovery), at the same\nposition, but at a reduced flux level (3.8\\,ct s$^{-1}$; EPIC-pn:\n0.2$-$2\\,keV).  i.e. it had reduced in flux by a factor of $\\approx$6\nin 72 days. XMM-Newton has not slewed over this area of sky since\nrev.\\,1246. Details of the relevant XMM-Newton slews, together with\nthe (0.2$-$2\\,keV) EPIC-pn source position, detected source counts,\ncount rate and detection likelihood are given in\nTable~\\ref{slewtable}.\n\nThe fact that XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 is detected in the total-band\n(0.2$-$12\\,keV) and the soft-band (0.2$-$2\\,keV), whilst effectively\nzero counts are seen in the hard-band (2$-$12\\,keV), is immediately\nindicative of the source being very soft. \n\nThe moderately high count rate indicates that the spectrum is affected\nby pile-up (the on-axis limit is 6\\,ct s$^{-1}$ for EPIC-pn full-frame\nmode\n\\footnote{http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm\\_user\\_support/documentation\n  /uhb\\_2.5/index.html}). This distorts the spectrum and makes\nquantitative spectral analysis of the slew data difficult. We\nminimized these effects by following the standard procedure, i.e.\nignoring the central part of the Point Spread Function (PSF), and\nextracted an event spectrum (containing single and double events) of\nthe source from within an annulus of 5\\arcsec$-$30\\arcsec\\ radius,\ncentred on the source position. Unresolved problems associated with\nthe motion of sources across the detector still exist within slew\ndata, and approximations currently have to be made when calculating\nthe associated effective area and detector response matrix files. In\norder to perform qualitative spectral analysis, an effective area file\nwas generated by averaging the individual core-removed effective area\nfiles at 9 different positions along the detector track made by the\nsource. This accounts for the removal of the piled-up core, and takes\nthe vignetting and PSF variations into account to a good\napproximation.  Individual BACKSCAL values have been set by hand, as\nhave the EXPOSURE values, estimated by calculating the distance\ntravelled by the source in detector coordinates and finding the time\ntaken to do this, given a 90\\,deg\\,hr$^{-1}$ slew speed, then\nsubtracting the appropriate fractions for chip gaps and bad pixels.\nFor the response matrix, we used the equivalent canned detector\nresponse matrix for the vignetting-weighted average source position,\nfor single plus double events and for full-frame mode:\nepn\\_ff20\\_sdY6\\_v6.9.rmf. A background spectrum was extracted from a\nmuch larger circular region close to the source and at a similar\noff-axis angle.\n\nTo fit the slew spectral data, and indeed all the high-energy spectra\nin the present paper, the\nXSPEC\\footnote{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xspec/}\nspectral fitting package has been used. As $\\chi^2$ minimization is\nnot valid when fitting spectra of low statistical quality, for the\nfitting of the slew spectrum (and all the spectral fitting in the\npresent paper), C-statistics have been used. To take into account the\nabsorbing column along the line of sight, the {\\em wabs} model with\nthe {\\em wilm} cosmic abundance table (Wilms et al.\\ 2000) has been\nused throughout the paper. All the errors quoted in the present paper\nare 90\\% confidence intervals, unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe rev.\\,1210 slew spectrum shows that the source is very soft, and\nappears consistent with a 63$_{-10}^{+12}$\\,eV black body, absorbed by\na hydrogen column density of\n8.2$_{-4.1}^{+5.4}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. The fit is good, with a\nP-statistic value of 0.11, obtained via the XSPEC {\\em goodness}\ncommand for this fit, based on 5000 random simulations. The best-fit\nhydrogen column is equal to the full Galactic hydrogen column in the\ndirection of the source (8.0$\\pm{1.1}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$; Dickey\n\\& Lockman, 1990, calculated via the FTOOL {\\em\n  nh}\\footnote{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ftools/fhelp/nh.txt}).\nThe slew spectrum, plus the best fit simple black body model and the\ndeviations from the model, are shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{slewspec}. The\nobserved count rate corresponds to a (0.2$-$2\\,keV) flux, corrected\nfor the removal of the saturated PSF core, of\n4.8$^{+2.7}_{-1.6}\\times10^{-11}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (an\nincrease in flux over the RASS upper limit, assuming the same spectral\nmodel, by a factor of more than 500).\n\nSimple power-law, thermal Bremmstrahlung, and other optically thin hot\nplasma models are unable to fit the spectrum adequately well.  Given\nthat we later are able to identify the source as a nova (Section~5.2),\nthen the black-body model will likely be a good approximation.\nFurthermore, as we have obtained here a moderate number of slew\ncounts, the more physically realistic, though more complex atmosphere\nmodel for CO white dwarfs of MacDonald \\& Vennes (1991), provided by\nK.\\,Page (private communication), was attempted.  This model, used\ne.g. to model the nova V1974 Cyg (Balman et al.\\ 1998), yielded a\nmarginal fit (and not formally a more statistically significant fit;\nP-statistic = 0.03, based on 5000 random simulations), with an\neffective temperature of 70$^{+8}_{-6}$\\,eV, an $N_{\\rm H}$ of\n3.7$^{+3.2}_{-2.5}$$\\times$$10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$, and a PSF-corrected\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) flux of 4.5$^{+1.3}_{-1.8}\\times10^{-11}$\\,ergs\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Note that a smaller $N_{\\rm H}$ (though perhaps\nstill consistent with the full Galactic hydrogen column) is now\nobtained using the white dwarf atmosphere model. (Note that the\nMacDonald \\& Vennes (1991) ONe white dwarf atmosphere model was also\nattempted, but yielded a marginally worse fit than the CO white dwarf\natmosphere model; only the CO atmosphere model has been used in the\nsubsequent analysis).\n\nIt is well known (e.g. Krautter et al.\\ 1996) that, because of the\nenergy-dependent opacity in the white dwarf atmosphere, fits to super\nsoft source novae spectra with black body models give larger fluxes\nand lower temperatures than atmosphere models fit to the same spectra,\nand this is seen in the present case. Thus the black body model\nrequires a larger $N_{\\rm H}$ to fit the same data than the atmosphere\nmodel, as is seen. \n\nThe model normalizations, corrected for the removal\nof the saturated PSF core, can be used to derive an approximate\ndistance to the source.  If we assume a typical emitting region for\nthe white dwarf atmosphere to be of spherical radius 10$^{9}$\\,cm,\nthen, for the black body model, this distance turns out to be\n20$^{+31}_{-10}$\\,kpc. The effects discussed above however can lead to\nusage of the black body model giving rise to an underestimation of the\ndistance.  For the white dwarf atmosphere model, a larger distance of\n71$^{+27}_{-23}$\\,kpc is obtained. Both estimates are consistent with\nthe distance to the LMC ($\\sim$50\\,kpc, see Section~6), and assuming a\ndistance of 50\\,kpc, the black body derived flux corresponds to a\n(pile-up corrected) 0.2$-$2\\,keV X-ray luminosity of\n1.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\\times10^{37}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=100 20 575 700,clip,width=6.0cm,angle=270]{12082f1.ps}\n\\caption{XMM-Newton Slew spectrum of XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 from\n  XMM-Newton revolution 1210.

We received over 14\\,ksec of Swift-XRT time in 7\nseparate observations and the details of these observations are listed\nin Table~\\ref{xrttable}. All of the observations were in photon\ncounting mode and none of the observations showed any times of\nsignificant high-BG flux. In none of the observations did the source\nposition coincide with any of the dead (micrometeorite-induced)\ndetector columns. The analysis has been performed using HEASOFT\nv6.1.2. The individual XRT observations were astrometrically-corrected\nand then stacked to ascertain a best Swift-XRT position $-$ this was\nfound to be 06 06 37.00 -69 49 33.9 (with a 90\\% error radius of\n4.0\\arcsec). Source counts were then extracted from each observation\nfrom a circle of radius of 40\\arcsec\\ at this position. Background\ncounts were extracted from each observation from large-radius\noff-source circles close to the source position. Source counts and\ncount rates for the individual XRT observations are given in\nTable~\\ref{xrttable}.\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n  \\caption[]{Details of the Swift-XRT observations (observation ID, observation date and \n    cleaned exposure time) are tabulated, together with the total (0.2$-$2.0\\,keV) background-subtracted \n    counts and count rate from XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 (see text).}\n  \\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{ccrrr}\n\\hline\nID          & Date     & Exp. & Counts       & Count rate       \\\\ \n            &   (UT)   &  (s) &              & (s$^{-1}$)        \\\\ \\hline \n00030895001 & 28/02/07 & 1955 & 23.9$\\pm$5.1 & 0.0122$\\pm$0.0026  \\\\\n00030895002 & 07/03/07 & 1796 & 15.8$\\pm$4.2 & 0.0088$\\pm$0.0024 \\\\\n00030895003 & 08/03/07 & 1651 & 10.9$\\pm$3.6 & 0.0066$\\pm$0.0022 \\\\\n00030895004 & 08/03/07 & 2547 & 20.6$\\pm$4.8 & 0.0081$\\pm$0.0019 \\\\\n00030895005 & 10/03/07 & 2550 & 29.5$\\pm$5.7 & 0.0116$\\pm$0.0022 \\\\\n00030895006 & 20/03/07 &  552 &  8.6$\\pm$3.2 & 0.0156$\\pm$0.0057 \\\\\n00030895007 & 22/03/07 & 3391 & 24.4$\\pm$5.4 & 0.0072$\\pm$0.0016 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{xrttable}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe observation naturally fell into three time-separated groups, those\nof obs.\\,1, obs.\\,2-5 and obs.\\,6-7.

An\nARF file was created using {\\em xrtmkarf} and the appropriate RMF\n(swxpc0to12\\_20010101v008.rmf) from the Swift-XRT Calibration Database\nwas obtained.\n\nStandard spectral models were again fit to the spectral data using\nXSPEC. Again, C-statistics were used, as was the {\\em wabs} absorption\nmodel with the {\\em wilm} cosmic abundance table. It was again \nobvious that only a very soft spectrum would be appropriate for the\ndata, and the only simple model that was able to fit the data\nadequately was a black-body model of temperature\n$kT$=$59^{+14}_{-10}$\\,eV, with an absorbing hydrogen column of\n9.5$^{+5.0}_{-3.9}$$\\times$$10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. No sufficiently constrained parameters could\nbe obtained using the CO white dwarf atmosphere model (MacDonald \\&\nVennes 1991). The Swift-XRT spectrum, together with the best-fit black\nbody model is shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{xrtspec}. The corresponding\n(0.2$-$2.0\\,keV) flux is 2.7$^{+0.7}_{-1.2}\\times10^{-13}$\\,ergs\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (i.e. a reduction by more than a factor 100 from\nthe XMM-Newton slew discovery flux), and the X-ray luminosity, for the\nassumed distance of 50\\,kpc, is 8.0$^{+2.2}_{-3.5}\\times10^{34}$\\,ergs\ns$^{-1}$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=100 15 580 710,clip,width=6.0cm,angle=270]{12082f2.ps}\n\\caption{Swift-XRT spectrum from XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933.

Though great care\nshould be taken in interpreting this result, as the black body model\nis possibly overestimating the luminosity, this obtained radius is\nstill consistent with that of moderately massive ($>$1.1$M_{\\odot}$)\nwhite dwarfs (Hamada \\& Salpeter 1961), i.e.\\,the whole white dwarf\nsurface may still be emitting at 59\\,eV.\n\n\\section{Dedicated XMM-Newton observations}\n\nWe were granted an XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation,\nonce the source became again visible to XMM-Newton, and a 10\\,ks\nXMM-Newton EPIC observation was made on 19th June 2007 (see\nTable~\\ref{slewtable}). All the XMM-Newton EPIC data, i.e.  the data\nfrom the two MOS cameras and the single pn camera, were taken in\nfull-frame mode with the thin filter in place.  These data from the\nthree EPIC instruments have been reprocessed using the standard\nprocedures in XMM-Newton SAS (Science Analysis System) $-$ v.7.1.0.\nPeriods of high-background, of which there were very few, were\nfiltered out of each dataset by creating a high-energy 10$-$15\\,keV\nlightcurve of single events over the entire field of view, and\nselecting times when this lightcurve peaked above 0.75\\,ct s$^{-1}$\n(for pn) or 0.25\\,ct s$^{-1}$ (for MOS). This resulted in\n$\\approx$9.4(8.0)\\,ks of low-background MOS(pn) data. Details of this dedicated\nXMM-Newton observation, together with source position, and\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) all-EPIC combined (pn, MOS1, MOS2) detected source\ncounts, count rate and detection likelihood are given in\nTable~\\ref{slewtable}.\n\nSource spectra, containing single and double events, were extracted\nfrom the datasets from circles (none of the data were now piled up)\ncentred on the source position. An extraction radius, estimated from\nwhere the radial surface brightness profile was seen to fall to the\nsurrounding background level, was set to 30\\arcsec. Background spectra\nwere extracted from each cleaned dataset from a 40\\arcsec$-$80\\arcsec\\\nannulus centred on the source position. Point sources seen to\ncontaminate these larger-area background spectra were removed from the\nbackground spectra to a radius of 60\\arcsec. ARF files were created\nfor the source spectra, and were checked to confirm that the correct\nextraction area calculations had been performed. Finally RMF response\nfiles were generated.\n \nStandard spectral models were again fit to the spectral data using\nXSPEC. Once again it was obvious that only a very soft model would fit the data; the only\nsimple model that was able to fit the data well (a P-statistic = 0.17,\nbased on 5000 random simulations) was a black-body model of\ntemperature $kT$=70$^{+3}_{-4}$\\,eV, with an absorbing hydrogen column\nof 6.9$^{+1.0}_{-1.6}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. The spectrum, together with this best-fit\nmodel are shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{xmmspec}. The corresponding\n(0.2$-$2.0\\,keV) flux is only marginally less than the Swift-XRT value\nat 2.2$^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\\times10^{-13}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and the\nX-ray luminosity (for the assumed distance of 50\\,kpc) is\n6.7$^{+2.5}_{-2.8}\\times10^{34}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=110 15 570 705,clip,width=6.0cm,angle=270]{12082f3.ps}\n\\caption{XMM-Newton ToO spectrum from XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933.

This yielded a marginal fit (and formally\na no more statistically significant fit; P-statistic = 0.04, based on\n5000 random simulations), with an effective temperature of\n73$^{+3}_{-2}$\\,eV, and an $N_{\\rm H}$ of\n3.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.8}$$\\times$$10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. Again, usage of the black body model results\nin a larger fitted $N_{\\rm H}$ and a lower fitted temperature than\nwith the atmosphere model. \n\n\nAs before, the model normalization can be used to obtain a cautious\nestimate of the size of the emitting region. For the assumed distance\nof 50\\,kpc, then the black body model returns an emitting region\nradius of only 1.3$\\pm$0.2$\\times$10$^{8}$\\,cm.  Again care should be\ntaken, as this may be an overestimation, the black body model having\nperhaps overestimated the luminosity. For the white dwarf atmosphere\nmodel, a smaller radius of 0.4$\\pm$0.1$\\times$10$^{8}$\\,cm is\nobtained. Note further that the assumption of a larger distance (see\nSection~6) would result in a proportionally larger emitting radius.\nThe range in allowed radius therefore is quite large, and it is not\nimpossible for for the whole of the white dwarf surface to be emitting\nat 70\\,eV. If this is the case, then the white dwarf would have to be\nat the high end of the mass range ($>$1.2$M_{\\odot}$; Hamada \\&\nSalpeter 1961). It may be the case then that we are at this point at,\nor close to the end of the SSS phase, where the effective temperature\nhas reached a maximum (Sala \\& Hernanz 2005), as is tentatively seen\nin the spectral fitting results, and where the photospheric radius has\nreached a minimum, close to the white dwarf radius.\n\n\n\\subsection{X-ray variability}\n\nThe full (XMM-Newton slew plus Swift-XRT plus XMM-Newton ToO) X-ray\nlightcurve of XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 is shown in\nFig.\\,\\ref{lightcurve}. The calculated (0.2$-$2.0\\,keV) flux values\nare shown plotted against the number of days since the rev.\\,1210\nXMM-Newton Slew discovery. The first two data points are the\nrev.\\,1210 and the rev.\\,1246 XMM-Newton Slew observations. Then the\nthree nested Swift-XRT points are shown and finally the XMM-Newton ToO\nobservation. The level of RASS upper limit is shown to the bottom\nleft. The (0.2$-$2.0\\,keV) X-ray flux is seen to have dropped by more\nthan two orders of magnitude in 230 days since the discovery, but is\nthen seen to have levelled off for the next 120 days, at a level still\n$\\approx$3 times that of the RASS. Finally, no evidence for any\nshort-term variability (using time bins down to 100\\,s) is seen in the\nhighest statistic continuous X-ray lightcurve (the $\\approx$8.0\\,ksec\nbackground-filtered EPIC-pn lightcurve) obtained from the 19/06/07\nXMM-Newton observation.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=60 60 550 454,clip,width=8.7cm]{12082f4.ps}\n\\caption{The full X-ray lightcurve of XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933.

Swift UVOT images in these two filters of the area\nof sky around XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 are shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{uvot}.\n\nPrior to the Swift UVOT observations, a `best-guess' to the possible\ncandidate optical/IR counterpart would have been the USNO-A2.0 source\n0150-04066298 (B~mag: 17.4, R~mag: 16.1), seen 4\\arcsec\\ south of the\nXMM-Newton slew position. The UVOT images however immediately showed\nthat the optically fainter source at position RA, Dec (J2000) = 06 06\n36.4, -69 49 34.3 (error radius: ~0.5\\arcsec) was a very strong UVW2\nsource and very blue, and was very likely the true counterpart to\nXMMSL1~J060636.2-694933. (The UVW2 filter spans approximately\n800\\AA\\,, centred at $\\approx$1900\\AA)\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=-82 210 695 585,clip,width=8.7cm]{12082f5.ps}\n\\caption{Swift UVOT images of the field around XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 from observation\n  00030895002.

The small circle in the UVW2 image around the\n  bright source is reproduced in the B image, indicating that a faint\n  optical source is also visible at this position.}\n\\label{uvot}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe Swift UVOT pipeline processed data were analysed using the UVOT\nphotometry package {\\em uvotsource} released with\nFTOOLs\\footnote{http://heasarc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ftools/ftools\\_menu.html}.\nThis package performs aperture photometry on pre-specified source and\nbackground regions, accounting for photometric- (via PSF fitting) and\ncoincidence loss- effects using the UVOT calibration files. Source\ncounts were extracted using a 5\\arcsec\\ radius aperture centred on the\nsource, while for the background we used a 10\\arcsec\\ radius aperture\nlocated in a nearby source-free region.  We used a larger background\naperture to effectively smooth over the modulo-8 fixed pattern noise\npresent in UVOT observations and to improve the statistics of the\nbackground counts. Source counts were converted to UVOT UV-magnitudes\nusing the UVW2 zero-point calibration released with version~2.8 (Build\n22) of the CALDB. The source is seen (see Fig.\\,\\ref{uvotlc}) to be\nroughly constant over the short duration of the Swift observations,\nwith a suggestion of a decline towards the end. This is in keeping\nwith the general form of the X-ray lightcurve (Fig.\\,\\ref{lightcurve})\nat this time.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=80 70 535 380,clip,width=8.7cm]{12082f6.ps}\n\\caption{Variation of the UVW2 magnitude of the bright UV source\n  during the Swift observations.

UVOT files, created using {\\em uvot2pha} for\nthe five observations (00030895002, 00030895004, 00030895005,\n00030895006 \\& 00030895007) where the UVW2 filter was employed, were\nincorporated into {\\em xspec}, along with the appropriate response\nfile (swuw2\\_20041120v104.rsp) from the Swift-XRT Calibration\nDatabase. We attempted to fit a single black-body spectrum to the\nSwift-XRT+UV data (again using C-statistics, the {\\em wabs} absorption\nmodel and the {\\em wilm} cosmic abundance table, plus the inclusion of\nthe {\\em xspec-redden} component to model the absorption in the UV\nband). The best fit however, with a much lower temperature of\n$kT$=$36^{+3}_{-4}$\\,eV, is a very poor fit to the data; we obtain a\n{\\em goodness} P-statistic value of 0.00, based on 5000 random\nsimulations. This notwithstanding, a flux in the UVW2\n(1.57$-$7.77\\,eV) band of 3.5$\\pm{0.2}\\times10^{-13}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ can be obtained, corresponding to a UVW2 luminosity, for the\nassumed distance of 50\\,kpc, of 1.0$\\pm{0.1}\\times10^{35}$\\,ergs\ns$^{-1}$.\n\nThe very poor single black-body fit above, plus the large change in\nfitted temperature is strongly suggestive that a model other than, or\nin addition to the XRT-derived kT=59\\,eV black body model (Section~3)\nshould be used to describe the UVW2 data. As we have no UV data other\nthan in the UVW2 filter, all that can be done is to apply the\nXRT-derived black body model to the UVW2+XRT data, and in doing this,\na large flux excess with respect to the XRT-derived black body model\nis seen in the UVW2 band. This is shown in Fig.\\ref{xrtuvotspec}. This\nexcess in UV emission (most of the $10^{35}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$ discussed\nabove) is likely due to a combination of residual post-nova nuclear\nburning on the surface of the white dwarf, plus accretion in the disk,\nincluding from emission lines. The situation is likely to be rather\ncomplex, depending on the structure of both the ejecta and the\naccretion disk, and is beyond the scope of the present work, where we\nonly have sparse UV data.  For a review of the UV emission from\nclassical novae, see Shore (2008).\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=100 15 580 710,clip,width=6.0cm,angle=270]{12082f7.ps}\n\\caption{Swift-XRT spectrum (black) from XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933, plus\n  the best-fit black-body model to this spectrum (Section~3; Fig.\\,2),\n  but extending into the UV to the Swift-UVOT UVW2 flux points (coloured)\n  (see text).

Images were obtained through the Sloan\n$g^\\prime$, $r^\\prime$ and $i^\\prime$ filters. On Nov.~15, 2007\nconditions were photometric and the Landolt field RU 149A was observed\nto flux calibrate the data in the $g^\\prime$, $r^\\prime$ and\n$i^\\prime$--bands.  The Landolt (1992) magnitudes of the standards\nwere converted to Sloan magnitudes using the transformations presented\nin Smith et al.\\ (2002). All the images were debiased and flatfielded\nusing dome flatfield frames. We applied aperture photometry on each of\nthe images using DAOPHOT in \\textsc{IRAF}\\footnote{\\textsc {iraf} is\n  distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories} to\ncompute the instrumental magnitudes of the stars. Differential\nphotometry of the optical counterpart to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933\n(marked by an arrow in Fig.~\\ref{magellan}) was performed with respect\nto the field star (marked with a `c' in Fig.~\\ref{magellan}). This was the\nbrightest isolated and unsaturated star common to all frames.  The\ncalibrated brightness of this comparison star is $g'= 18.42 \\pm 0.04$,\n$r'= 17.85 \\pm 0.06$ and $i'=17.58 \\pm 0.07$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=35 215 575 575,clip,width=8.7cm]{12082f8.ps}\n\\caption{Magellan Clay LDSS3 finder chart. The counterpart to\n  XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 (and the bright Swift-UVOT UVW2-filter\n  source; Figs.\\ref{uvot}\\&\\ref{uvotlc}) is marked with an arrow. The comparison star is\n  shown marked with a 'c'.}\n\\label{magellan}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn addition to the imaging observations described above, we have\nobtained spectroscopic observations on Nov.~13, 14, and 15, 2007 using\nthe VPH All grism, which has 660 lines per mm, and employing a\n1\\arcsec\\ wide slit. This set-up provides a mean dispersion of 2\\AA\\,\nper pixel. For a slit width of 1 arcsecond and a mean seeing close to\n1\\arcsec, the mean spectral resolution is $\\approx$10\\AA. On Nov.~13, 2007\nwe took 4 exposures of 450\\,s each, on Nov.~14, 2007 we took 2\nexposures of 900\\,s each, and on Nov.~15, 2007 we took one 1200\\,s\nexposure with the slit at the parallactic angle. The spectra were bias\nand flatfield corrected, and extracted in \\textsc{IRAF}. The\ninstrumental response was corrected using the spectrophotometric flux\ncalibrators LTT 3218 (Nov.~13), H600 (Nov.~14) and LTT 9293 (Nov.~15).\nSignificant differences in the flux around H$\\alpha$ are apparent with\nthe flux being 50\\% higher during the Nov.~15, 2007 with respect to\nthe Nov.~13, 2007 observations. Since there is no evidence for\nbrightening in the $r^\\prime$ images we attribute the difference to\nthe fact that the source was not observed at the parallactic angle on\nNov.~13 and 14, 2007. We exported the one dimensional spectra to the\nspectral analysis software package \\textsc{molly} for further\nanalysis.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=70 30 600 800,clip,width=6.8cm,angle=270]{12082f9.ps}\n\\caption{Magellan Clay averaged optical spectrum of the optical source\n  associated with XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933. The flux scaling is\n  approximate. The prominent strong emission lines are marked (see\n  text). }\n\\label{optspec}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe have averaged all spectra (see Fig.~\\ref{optspec}). We find several\nstrong emission lines. The strongest of these emission lines are best\ninterpreted as due to [OIII] 4958.9\\AA\\, and 5006.9\\AA\\,, He~II at\n4685.8\\AA\\, and a blend of the H$\\alpha$ plus the [NII] at 6548.1\\AA\\,\nand 6583.4\\AA\\,, lines found often in novae (Williams 1992). In this\ncase the main [OIII] lines appear redshifted by approximately 2000\\,km\ns$^{-1}$. We interprete this as due to clumpy outflows in the nova\nshell. The integrated light from different outflowing parts can also\nexplain the substructure that is present in the [OIII] lines. The\noutflow velocities that we obtain for the H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines\nis $\\approx$350\\,km s$^{-1}$, hence less than that for the [OIII]\nlines.  Note that, if XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 does reside within the\nLMC, then the systematic line-of-sight recession velocity of the LMC,\n262$\\pm$3.4\\,km~s$^{-1}$ (van der Marel et al.\\ 2002), should be taken\ninto account; i.e.\\,a good fraction of the observed H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$\nrecession would then be due to the recession of the LMC itself.\n\n\\subsection{Long-term Optical light curve}\n\nAnalysis of archival robotic optical survey data from 3-minute CCD\nexposures (pixel size 14\\arcsec.8), obtained with a 70\\,mm (200\\,mm\nfocal length) f/2.8 telephoto lens in the course of the All Sky\nAutomated Survey (ASAS; Pojmanski 2002) show that the visual magnitude\nof this source rose from m$_{V}\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{>}{\\sim}$}$14 to m$_{V}$$\\approx$12 between\nSep.~18, 2005 and Sep.~30, 2005, and then declined rapidly thereafter (see\nFig.\\ref{optlc}). ASAS did not detect any significant emission from\nthe source after around November 2005, the source having dimmed below\nthe limiting magnitude of ASAS.\n\nThe decline from the brightest data point ($\\approx$2.2 magnitudes in\n10 days, then a further $\\sim$1.3 magnitudes in 46 days) suggests that\nthis is a nova of the 'very fast' speed class (Warner 1995, Downes\net al.\\ 2001). We estimate that the time that the light curve takes to\ndecline 2 magnitudes below maximum observed brightness is\n8$\\pm$2\\,days (see Section~6).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=30 78 453 549,clip,width=7.8cm,angle=270]{12082f10.ps}\n\\caption{All Sky Automated Survey V-band magnitudes of the optical counterpart \nto XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, during outburst (late September 2005) and afterwards.}\n\\label{optlc}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe optical spectrum, showing lines of [OIII] 4958.9\\AA\\, and\n5006.9\\AA\\,, He~II at 4685.8\\AA\\, and a blend of the H$\\alpha$ plus\n[NII] at 6548.1\\AA\\, and 6583.4\\AA\\, suggests that\nXMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 was a nova, observed (in Nov 2007) in the late\nA$_{0}$ auroral phase. The fact that the observed [OIII] lines are not\nin the more usual, optically thin 3:1 ratio, can be explained in terms\nof a clumpy outflow scenario, whereby individual clumps of both\nrest-frame and redward-shifted material are observed, and the\nsuperposition of these account for the observed [OIII] ratio (note\nfurther that density enhancements can change observed [OIII] ratios to\nmore like $\\sim$1:1). Clumps of material are often seen in nova ejecta\n(e.g. Shara et al.\\ 1997), and outflows of speeds around 2000\\,km\ns$^{-1}$ are not uncommon in novae (e.g. in nova LMC 1991; Schwartz\net al.\\ 2001).\n\nXMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 was likely at its onset (in Oct 2005) a very\nfast, Fe~{\\sc ii} nova (Section~3 and Williams et al.\\ 1991; Williams\net al.\\ 1994). An accurate classification now however is not possible,\nso late after maximum brightness. The soft ($kT_{\\rm\n  eff}$$\\approx$60--70\\,eV) X-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was\nin a super-soft source (SSS) state (Krautter 2008) during its\ndiscovery (in July 2006), and throughout its X-ray decline (by more\nthan two orders of magnitude) in the observations of Sept 2006, March\n2007 and June 2007.  Such a state originates from nuclear burning on\nthe surface of the white dwarf, and measurements of the intensity,\nduration, and temperature can be used to estimate the distance to the\nnova and the mass of the white dwarf (e.g. Balman et al.\\ 1998; Lanz\net al.\\ 2005). Indeed, we believe (Section~4) that the white dwarf\nwithin XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 may be quite massive\n($>$1.2$M_{\\odot}$).\n\nAs discussed earlier, classical novae are almost always discovered\noptically in the early phases of their outbursts.\nXMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is very unusual therefore in that it has been\ndiscovered first in X-rays. As such, it is useful to compare it with\nXMMSL1~J070542.7-381442 (also known as V598 Pup; Read et al.\\ 2008),\nanother nova recently discovered (in X-rays) in the XMM-Newton slew\nsurvey. With a peak $m_{V}$ of $\\ltsim12$, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is\nnot a particularly bright nova (c.f. V598 Pup, which reached an\nm$_{V}$ of $\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}$}$4), and so it is not surprising that it went\nunnoticed, only being discovered in X-rays during the later (here\n291\\,days after the outburst), optically thin nebular phase, when\nclassical novae are typically observed as soft X-ray sources. Though\nthis delay should be taken as a upper limit, it is long when compared\nto V598 Pup ($\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}$}$127 days), but may instead be more similar to the\ndelays of $\\sim$200 days seen in V1974 Cyg (Krautter et al.\\ 1996),\n$\\sim$6 months of V382 Vel (Orio et al.\\ 2002), and 6$-$8 months of\nV1494 Aql (Drake et al.\\ 2003). In their X-ray monitoring of optical\nnovae in M31, Pietsch et al.\\ (2007) detect 11 out of 34 novae in\nX-rays within a year after their optical outbursts. Seven novae are\nseen to be X-ray bright, several (3$-$9) years after outburst, and\nthree novae showed very short X-ray outbursts, starting within\n50\\,days of outburst, but lasting only two to three months.\nXMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 therefore is not particularly unusual.\n\nA method to estimate the distance to the nova is to use the relation\nbetween the absolute magnitude at maximum brightness and the time that\nthe light curve takes to decline 2 magnitudes below maximum\nbrightness, $t_{2}$ (Della Valle \\& Livio 1995). We have no\ninformation over the 12 days between the data point of maximum\nbrightness and the lower limit prior to this (Fig.\\,\\ref{optlc}), and\ntherefore we have no exact outburst date, nor exact apparent\nmagnitude at outburst.  Assuming for the moment though that we have\ncaught the outburst exactly in the Sep.~30, 2005 observation, then we\ncan estimate (Sect.~5.3) $t_{2}$ to be 8$\\pm$2\\,days, and using this,\nwe can estimate (Della Valle \\& Livio 1995) the absolute magnitude at\nmaximum brightness $M_{V}$ to be --8.7$\\pm$0.6. An absolute magnitude\nof $M_{V}$=--8.7 implies a peak luminosity $\\sim$7 times the Eddington\nluminosity for a 1\\,$M_{\\odot}$ white dwarf. This is quite typical of\nnovae.\n\nWith $A_{V}$=0.39$^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$ (90\\% error), as derived (Predehl\n\\& Schmitt 1995) from $N_{\\rm\n  H}$=6.9$^{+1.0}_{-1.6}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$ (from the highest\nstatistic spectral fit; the XMM-Newton ToO observation), and with\n$M_{V}$=--8.7$\\pm$0.6, and a peak $m_{V}$ of 12.0, we can derive a\ndistance to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 of 115$^{+43}_{-30}$\\,kpc.  As\ndiscussed above however, we are unsure as to the exact outburst date\nand the maximum brightness at outburst. Our assumed peak $m_{V}$ of\n12.0 is almost certainly an underestimation. Although we have no\ninformation in the 12 days prior to Sep.~30, 2005, a simple linear\nextrapolation of the early October lightcurve back prior to Sep.~30,\n2005 suggests that the actual peak $m_{V}$ was somewhere between 9 and\n12. The corresponding distance estimates are then between 29 and\n115\\,kpc (with a mid-point $m_{V}$=10.5 value yielding a distance\nestimate of 58\\,kpc). Many methods have been used to estimate the\ndistance to the LMC (e.g.  Kovacs 2000, Nelson et al.\\ 2000), but a\nvalue of around 50\\,kpc appears to be quite robust. Our distance\nestimate is certainly consistent with that of the LMC, though the\nerrors are quite large.  It does appear to be the case however, that\nour distance estimate places the source far outside of our own Galaxy.\nThis, together with the source's position on the sky (at the eastern\nedge of the LMC) and the sizable ($\\sim$Galactic) X-ray hydrogen\ncolumn densities obtained from the spectral fits, suggest strongly\nthat XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 lies within the LMC itself.  Note further\nthat the (pile-up corrected) spectral model normalizations to the\ninitial Slew discovery data (Sect.~2) also imply an approximate\ndistance to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 of $\\sim$50\\,kpc.\n\nThe source had, at the time of the slew detection, an absorbed\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) X-ray flux of 4.8$^{+2.7}_{-1.6}\\times10^{-11}$\\,ergs\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a 0.2$-$2\\,keV X-ray luminosity\n(at 50\\,kpc) of 1.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\\times10^{37}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$.\nAssuming instead for the moment a distance more like 100\\,kpc (though\nthis is thought to be well beyond the LMC, e.g. Kovacs 2000), then the\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) X-ray luminosity of\n5.7$^{+3.0}_{-1.9}\\times$$10^{37}$\\,erg s$^{-1}$ obtained is at the high end of the X-ray luminosities of\nclassical SSS-phase novae discussed e.g.\\,in Orio et al.\\ (2002) and\nNess et al.\\ (2007). As discussed though, we have very likely missed\nthe outburst peak, and as such, our more probable assumed distance of\n50\\,kpc gives rise to a more typical SSS-phase X-ray luminosity.  The\nluminosities of 7$-$8$\\times$$10^{34}$\\,erg s$^{-1}$, obtained during\nthe Swift and pointed XMM-Newton observations, are more typical of\nnovae at later times, when the emission can also sometimes be\ndescribed by a thermal plasma, rather than a black-body type spectrum,\nor a more mixed spectrum, due to the complex structure of the ejecta\nand the accretion disk (Krautter 2008, Shore 2008).\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nA bright X-ray source, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, was detected in an\nXMM-Newton slew on 18 July 2006 at a position where no previous X-ray\nsource had been seen. The XMM-Newton slew data, plus follow-up dedicated\nXMM-Newton and Swift observations, plus optical imaging and\nspectroscopic data acquired with the Magellan Clay telescope and \nAll-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) data were used to classify the new object\nas a nova, and to examine its properties. The primary conclusions are\nas follows:\n\n  \\begin{itemize}\n\n  \\item The soft X-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was in a\n    super-soft source (SSS) state at its discovery in July 2007\n    (XMM-Newton slew) and through its X-ray decline (by over two\n    orders of magnitude) in September 2006 (XMM-Newton slew), March\n    2007 (Swift) and June 2007 (XMM-Newton).\n\n  \\item The Magellan optical spectrum (Nov 2007) of the source\n    indicates that it was very likely then a nova in the late\n    A$_{0}$ auroral phase.\n\n  \\item The very fast optical decline (ASAS) during the nova's onset\n    (Oct 2005), indicates that the initial nova was likely of speed class\n    'very fast'.\n\n  \\item The very fast speed, together with the absolute magnitude at\n    maximum brightness and the X-ray absorption, give rise to a\n    distance to the source far beyond our own Galaxy. The large\n    distance, together with the source's position in the sky, at the\n    eastern edge of the LMC, and the spectral information from the\n    X-ray data, are very suggestive that the nova is situated within\n    the LMC itself.\n\n  \\item Analysis of XMM-Newton slew data is continuing to provide a\n    powerful means of finding new X-ray transient objects.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\n\n  The XMM-Newton project is an ESA Science Mission with instruments\n  and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and the USA\n  (NASA).
