    "answer": "Elephants are connected to Gajabrishta through the meaning of the word \"Gaja\" in Sanskrit, which means elephant. The back or hip portion of a sitting elephant is referred to as \"Brishta.\" The later Cholas of the Chola empire in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in Thondai Mandalam around North Tamil Nadu, constructed temples with vimanas in this style. The sanctum sanctorum of these temples, especially Shiva temples, had this style of vimana."
