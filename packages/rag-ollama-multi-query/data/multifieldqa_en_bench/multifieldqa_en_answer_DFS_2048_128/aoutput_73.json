    "answer": "Some reasons for the lack of data sharing in archaeobotany include technological limitations, resistance among some archaeologists to making their data available due to concerns about exposing data to scrutiny, lost opportunities of analysis before others use it, and the perception of the value of reusing previously published archaeobotanical data being low. Control over how data tables are presented and the emphasis on creating new data through archaeological research are also contributing factors."
