    "answer": "The proposed approach in this research paper is based on approximating the posterior distribution with an isotropic Gaussian distribution in order to develop a linear-complexity algorithm for adaptive filtering, specifically for least-mean-squares (LMS). This probabilistic approach offers advantages such as a novel LMS algorithm with adaptable step size, fewer free parameters compared to previous LMS algorithms, and providing an estimate of the error variance, which is useful in many applications."
