    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE) depending on whether the CPUE is standardized by hook number or not. When CPUE is unstandardized, there is a positive relationship between catch per set and number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. However, when CPUE is standardized by hook number, the relationships are reversed, with catch per set being negatively related to these fishing behavior variables. This indicates that standardizing CPUE by hook number can change the relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables."
