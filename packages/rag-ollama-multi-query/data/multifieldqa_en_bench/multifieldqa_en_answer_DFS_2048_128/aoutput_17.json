    "answer": "The function beta(r) is determined in the derivation by exploiting the symmetries of the solutions as well as the properties of infalling observers. Additionally, the Einstein equations are used to link the matter content with the geometry of spacetime, specifically applying the vacuum Einstein equations to describe the spacetime metric outside a spherically-symmetric matter distribution."
