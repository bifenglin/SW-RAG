    "answer": "It is important for the sides of the fuselage to be sloped (tumbled home) because if the sides were not sloped, the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. However, since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is conical, which allows for the longerons to be properly shaped and positioned in the fuselage construction process."
