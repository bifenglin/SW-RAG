    "answer": "The main focus of the research paper is to study the nuclear transition and nuclear interaction via lattice QCD, particularly through the dual formulation in the strong coupling regime. It aims to understand the nature of the transition and its dependence on parameters such as quark mass and inverse gauge coupling. The paper also discusses methods to overcome the sign problem in lattice QCD simulations and compares findings with other results related to nuclear interactions."
