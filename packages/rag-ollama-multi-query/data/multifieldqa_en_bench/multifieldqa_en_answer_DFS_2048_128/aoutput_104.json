    "answer": "Smartphones are more compact and power-constrained compared to tablets. Smartphone SoCs are limited to around 1W, while tablet SoCs have a much greater power budget, up to 4W for passively cooled devices and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans. Additionally, smartphones typically have a cellular modem integrated into the SoC itself, while tablets default to Wi-Fi connectivity rather than a cellular modem."
