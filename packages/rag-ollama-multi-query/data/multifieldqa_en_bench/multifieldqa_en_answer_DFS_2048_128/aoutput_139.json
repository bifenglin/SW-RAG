    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system is that they achieve higher similarity scores than CNNs with the same depth and almost the same architectures when analyzing neural representation similarity experiments with biological neural responses. This indicates that SNNs could be a powerful tool for research on the visual system and may serve as a shortcut to explore the biological visual cortex."
