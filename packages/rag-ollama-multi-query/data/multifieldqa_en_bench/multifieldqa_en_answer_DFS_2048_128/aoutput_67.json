    "answer": "The conduction gap is strongly dependent on the strain direction, with different values observed for different strain angles. Peaks in the conduction gap occur at specific strain angles, and the gap can be zero at certain angles depending on whether it is tensile or compressive strain. The relationship between strain direction and conduction gap is complex and varies based on the specific conditions of the strain and transport direction."
