    "answer": "The performance of the PLM with decimation is significantly better than the PLM with $l_2$ regularization and a mean-field technique in terms of reconstructing the network of interaction, especially for lower values of sample sizes. The PLM with decimation is able to reproduce the original network even when the sample size is equal to the number of variables, indicating its effectiveness in under-sampling regimes. Additionally, the reconstruction error obtained with the PLM and decimation is consistently smaller than that obtained with other techniques across different temperatures and sample sizes."
