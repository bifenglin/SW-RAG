    "answer": "The interlayer Berry connection polarizability is significant because it allows for a unique rectification functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems. It also plays a role in the development of a dc Hall current that can be controlled by the phase difference of two driving fields, leading to tunability and unique approaches to rectification and transport in chiral bilayers."
