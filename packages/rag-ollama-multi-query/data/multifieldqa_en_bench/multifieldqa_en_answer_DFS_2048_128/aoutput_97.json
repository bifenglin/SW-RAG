    "answer": "The average magnetic moment per column in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The text mainly discusses the structural and magnetic properties of the films, including the formation of nanocolumns, Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters, and the magnetic behaviors at different growth temperatures and Mn concentrations. Further information or calculations would be needed to determine the average magnetic moment per column."
