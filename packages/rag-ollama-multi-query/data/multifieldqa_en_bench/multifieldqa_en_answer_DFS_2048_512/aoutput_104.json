    "answer": "Smartphones are far more compact and power-constrained compared to tablets. Smartphone SoCs are limited to around 1W, while tablet SoCs can have a power budget of up to 4W for passively cooled devices and even higher for systems with fans. Additionally, smartphones require a cellular modem integrated into the SoC itself due to their connectivity needs, while tablets default to Wi-Fi connectivity and do not necessarily include cellular modems. The differences in power targets and expected performance between smartphones and tablets are quite large, leading to a wider range of designs for tablets compared to smartphones."
