    "answer": "SNNs show potential in modeling the visual system as they achieve higher similarity scores than CNNs and exhibit similar properties in further analyses. They are considered to be more biologically plausible neural networks and may serve as a shortcut to explore the biological visual cortex. Further research on different aspects of SNNs, such as model architectures, learning algorithms, processing mechanisms, and neural coding methods, is expected to provide better explanations for the complex and diverse vision systems in the future."
