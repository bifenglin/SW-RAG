    "answer": "The sides of the fuselage need to be sloped (tumbled home) in order to form a conical shape. If the sides were not sloped, the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would not lie flat. By sloping the sides, the section formed becomes conical, which allows the longerons to lay flat and creates the desired elliptical shape from the firewall to the tailstock."
