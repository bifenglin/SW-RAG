    "answer": "The dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter $m$ following a quench to the critical point is well described by the Gaussian theory for all three lattice gas models studied. In the short-time regime, $m \\sim t^{1/2}$ and the Binder cumulant $g$ of the lowest transverse mode is zero in this regime. However, the alternative order parameter $O$ distinguishes between the driven (IDLG, RDLG) and the equilibrium (LG) lattice gases."
