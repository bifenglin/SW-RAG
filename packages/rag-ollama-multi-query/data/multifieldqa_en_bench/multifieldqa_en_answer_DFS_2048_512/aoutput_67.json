    "answer": "The conduction gap is strongly dependent on the strain direction, with peaks occurring at specific angles such as $0^\\\\circ$, $30^\\\\circ$, and $90^\\\\circ$. It is also observed that the effects of strain in different directions are qualitatively similar, with peaks and zero values of the conduction gap occurring at the same angles in these two situations."
