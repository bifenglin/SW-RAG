    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it plays a crucial role in the unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers. It allows for the development of a dc Hall current that can be controlled by the phase difference of two driving fields, without affecting the magnitude of the double-frequency component. This tunability makes the effect a valuable tool for studying and manipulating chiral bilayers, such as small angle twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) and twisted bilayer graphene (tBG)."
