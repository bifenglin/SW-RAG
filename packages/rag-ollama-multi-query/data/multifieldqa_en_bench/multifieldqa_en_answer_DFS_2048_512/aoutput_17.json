    "answer": "The function beta(r) is determined by using the vacuum Einstein equations, specifically the equation (EinsteinVacuum), which relates the second derivative of the volume of a test ball with respect to proper time to be zero. This equation allows for the determination of beta(r) in the context of the spacetime metric."
