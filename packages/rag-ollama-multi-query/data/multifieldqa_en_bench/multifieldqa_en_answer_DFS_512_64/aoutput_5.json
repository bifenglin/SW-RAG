    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity can either enhance or suppress the Kondo effect, depending on the strength of the superconducting energy gap in comparison to the relevant Kondo temperature. It induces pairing in quantum dots and can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime."
