    "answer": "The interlayer Berry connection polarizability has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl, and it plays a significant role in the development of a dc Hall current in chiral bilayers. It allows for the control of the on/off, direction, and magnitude of the current by adjusting the phase difference of the two driving fields. This tunability makes it a unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers."
