    "answer": "The performance of the PLM with decimation is better than other methods, including the PLM with $l_2$ regularization and a mean-field-based method. The PLM with decimation is able to clearly infer the network of interaction even when $M=N$, and it outperforms the other methods in terms of reconstruction error across different temperatures and sample sizes. In particular, the error obtained with the PLM with decimation is several times smaller than the error estimated by the other methods."
