    "answer": "The dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter following a quench to the critical point is well described by the Gaussian theory, where in the short-time regime, it scales as $m \\sim t^{1/2}$ and the Binder cumulant $g$ of the lowest transverse mode is zero in this regime."
