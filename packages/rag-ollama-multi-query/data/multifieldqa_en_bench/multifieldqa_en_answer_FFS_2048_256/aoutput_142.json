    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by speeding up the motion when the shock wave passes through the bubble. Bubbles with a larger specific-heat ratio experience faster average motion compared to bubbles with a smaller specific-heat ratio because bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratios require more energy to compress their size, resulting in smaller translational energy."
