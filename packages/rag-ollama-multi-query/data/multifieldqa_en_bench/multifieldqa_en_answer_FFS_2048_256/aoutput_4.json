    "answer": "The sides of the fuselage need to be sloped (tumbled home) in order to form a conical shape. If the sides were not sloped, the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. By sloping the sides, a conical shape is formed, which is necessary for the overall shape of the fuselage."
