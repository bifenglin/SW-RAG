    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables differ for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE) when controlling for hook number. For standardised CPUE (individuals per 100 hooks per set), the relationship between catch per set and fishing behavior variables is reversed compared to unstandardised CPUE (individuals per set). In particular, standardised CPUE of bottom longlines is significantly higher than that of surface longlines when controlling for hook number. Additionally, there is a negative relationship between CPUE and fishing behavior variables such as number of hooks, number of sets, and engine power when CPUE is standardised by hook number."
