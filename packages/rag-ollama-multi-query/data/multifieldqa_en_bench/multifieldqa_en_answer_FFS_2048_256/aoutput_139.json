    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system is significant, as they have shown promising results in fitting neural representations, exploring the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system, and providing computational evidence of parallel information processing streams in different species. SNNs have outperformed traditional models and other neural networks in various experiments, demonstrating their ability to yield brain-like representations and shed light on visual processing mechanisms in both macaques and mice."
