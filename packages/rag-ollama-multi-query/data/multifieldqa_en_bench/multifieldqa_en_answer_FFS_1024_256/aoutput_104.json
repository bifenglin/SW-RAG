    "answer": "Smartphones and tablets are different from a technical perspective in terms of power budget for system on chips (SoCs), connectivity options, and design flexibility. Smartphones have a lower power budget for SoCs, limited design options due to the need for government certification and carrier approval, and default connectivity through cellular modems. On the other hand, tablets have a greater power budget for SoCs, more design flexibility, default connectivity through Wi-Fi, and are commonly sold directly to consumers rather than through carriers."
