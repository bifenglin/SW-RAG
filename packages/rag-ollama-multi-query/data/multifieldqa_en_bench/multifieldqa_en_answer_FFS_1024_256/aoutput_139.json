    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system is promising as they have been successful at predicting neural responses in the primate visual cortex, matching the hierarchy of the ventral visual stream and even controlling neural activity. Additionally, SNNs have shown to outperform other deep neural networks in fitting complex biological neural representations, demonstrating their potential as a novel and powerful tool for research on the visual system."
