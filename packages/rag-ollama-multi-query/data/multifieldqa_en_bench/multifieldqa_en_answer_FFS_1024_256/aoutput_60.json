    "answer": "The performance of the PLM with decimation drastically overcomes the performance of the PLM with $l_2$ regularization and a mean-field technique in terms of network reconstruction, especially for problems with sparse interaction networks. The error obtained with the PLM with decimation is several times smaller than the error estimated by the other methods."
