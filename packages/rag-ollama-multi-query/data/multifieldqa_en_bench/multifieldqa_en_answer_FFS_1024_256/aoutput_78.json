    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it leads to the development of a dc Hall current when two driving fields of the same frequency are applied. The on/off, direction, and magnitude of this Hall current can be controlled by the phase difference of the two fields. This characteristic tunability makes it a unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers."
