    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE) based on whether the CPUE is standardized or not. When CPUE is not standardized, there is a positive relationship between catch per set and variables such as number of hooks, number of sets, and engine power. However, when CPUE is standardized by hook number, there is a negative relationship between catch per set and these fishing behavior variables."
