    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by using linear and non-linear autoencoders to map high-dimensional time-series data to a lower-dimensional, latent representation. This latent representation allows for the identification of interpretable latent dynamics, ensuring that important properties are conserved in the reduced-order model. The time-continuous formulation of the framework also allows for the incorporation of sparse and irregularly sampled training data, as well as the fast generation of predictions after the training phase."
