    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE) when standardised CPUE is taken into account. For example, when looking at the relationship between CPUE per set and number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets, there is a positive relationship for unstandardised CPUE. However, when CPUE is standardised by hook number, there is a negative relationship between CPUE and these fishing behavior variables. This indicates that standardising CPUE allows for a more accurate comparison and understanding of the factors influencing catch per unit effort."
