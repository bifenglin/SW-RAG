    "answer": "Dendritic spines are rich in actin and have a complex network of proteins that link extracellular signals with the actin cytoskeleton, allowing for control of dendritic spine morphology and number. These structures are highly dynamic and play a critical role in the refinement of neural circuits, as well as the processing and storage of information within the brain."
