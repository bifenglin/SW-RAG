    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it leads to the development of a dc Hall current whose on/off, direction, and magnitude can be controlled by the phase difference of two driving fields of the same frequency. This effect allows for unique rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers."
