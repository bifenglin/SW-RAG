    "answer": "The dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter following a quench to the critical point is well described by the Gaussian theory, where it follows the scaling form $O \\sim t^{\\alpha} L_{\\parallel}^{-1/2}$. The value of $\\alpha$ depends on the lattice gas model being studied."
