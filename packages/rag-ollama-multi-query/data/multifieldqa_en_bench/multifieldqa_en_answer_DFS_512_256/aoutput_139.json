    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system lies in their ability to serve as a shortcut to explore the biological visual cortex. By studying various aspects of SNNs such as model architectures, learning algorithms, processing mechanisms, and neural coding methods, it is highly promising to better explain the sophisticated, complex, and diverse vision systems in the future."
