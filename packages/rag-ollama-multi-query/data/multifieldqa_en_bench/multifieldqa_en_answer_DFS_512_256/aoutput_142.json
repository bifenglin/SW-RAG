    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by contributing little to the motion during the shock compression stage, but speeding up the average motion when the shock wave passes through the bubble. This is because bubbles with a larger specific-heat ratio require less energy to compress their size, resulting in higher translational energy and faster average motion."
