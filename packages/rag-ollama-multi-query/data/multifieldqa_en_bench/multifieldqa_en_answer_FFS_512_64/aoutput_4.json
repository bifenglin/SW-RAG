    "answer": "It is important for the sides of the fuselage to be sloped (tumbled home) because it allows the section formed to be conical, which results in a shape that is elliptical when cut with a plane not perpendicular to its axis. This shape is necessary when constructing the fuselage box section with materials that cannot be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain."
