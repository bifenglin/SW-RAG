    "answer": "The vacuum processing system is configured with a plurality of vacuum processing apparatus arranged in parallel. Each vacuum processing apparatus includes vacuum processing chambers for processing wafers, which are symmetrically positioned with respect to the axis passing through the center of the vacuum transfer chamber and the locking device. Additionally, there are two vacuum processing chambers on the opposite side of the locking device around the vacuum transfer chamber. The arrangement of the two vacuum processing chambers with respect to the vacuum transfer chamber forms acute angles."
