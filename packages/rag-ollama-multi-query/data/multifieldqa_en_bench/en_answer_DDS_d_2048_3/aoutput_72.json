    "answer": "In the numerical experiments, the runtimes and iteration counts of NFPA and FPSA were significantly lower compared to GMRES and DSA for all cases tested. NFPA and FPSA outperformed GMRES and DSA by orders of magnitude in both runtime and iteration counts. Additionally, NFPA showed similar performance to FPSA in terms of runtime and iterations, with both methods greatly outperforming GMRES and DSA."
