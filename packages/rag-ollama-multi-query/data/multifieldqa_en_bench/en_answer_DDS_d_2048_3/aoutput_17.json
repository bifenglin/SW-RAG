    "answer": "The function beta(r) is determined in the derivation by using the simplified form of the vacuum Einstein equations, specifically the equation that describes the volume of a test ball in free fall around a specific event. By analyzing the deformation of the test ball, the requirement for the second time derivative of the volume to vanish leads to a differential equation for beta(r). The solution of this equation involves integration constants that are fixed by considering the behavior of beta(r) for large values of r in relation to the Newtonian limit. Ultimately, the function beta(r) is determined by solving the differential equation derived from the volume condition for the test ball."
