    "answer": "The transition probability of the environment affects the learning rate in the static agent by increasing the learning rate as the transition probability increases. Initially, the learning rate rapidly rises with an increase in the transition probability. However, after reaching a peak, the learning rate begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero as the transition probability continues to increase."
