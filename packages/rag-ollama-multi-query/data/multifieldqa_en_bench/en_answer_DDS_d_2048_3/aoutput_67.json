    "answer": "The conduction gap depends on the strain direction in a significant way. It has been shown that the conduction gap is strongly dependent on the direction of applied strain. Peaks of the conduction gap are observed at specific strain directions, such as $\\\\theta \\\\approx 47^\\\\circ$ and $133^\\\\circ$ for tensile strain, and $\\\\theta \\\\approx 43^\\\\circ$ and $137^\\\\circ$ for compressive strain. The conduction gap can be zero at certain strain angles, indicating a complex relationship between the conduction gap and the direction of applied strain."
