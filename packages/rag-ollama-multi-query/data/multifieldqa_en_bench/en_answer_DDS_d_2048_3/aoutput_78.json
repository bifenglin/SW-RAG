    "answer": "The interlayer Berry connection polarizability has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl, and it is responsible for the intrinsic Hall response in twisted bilayers. It arises from the layer hybridization of electrons due to the twisted interlayer coupling, allowing for unique rectification functionality and serving as a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems."
