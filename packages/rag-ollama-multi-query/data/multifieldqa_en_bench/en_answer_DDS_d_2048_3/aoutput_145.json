    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE). When looking at unstandardized CPUE (individuals per set), there is a positive relationship between catch per set and factors such as number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. However, when considering standardized CPUE (individuals per 100 hooks per set), the relationships are reversed. In this case, standardizing CPUE by hook number shows that catch per unit effort is actually higher for bottom longlines compared to surface longlines. This indicates that increasing fishing effort, such as adding more hooks, may lead to diminishing returns and lower catch per unit effort for certain fishing gears and practices."
