    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity has a significant effect on the Kondo effect. It can suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap becomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature. On the other hand, the strength of superconducting pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime. For example, for quantum dots attached to superconducting and normal contacts, it can enhance the Kondo effect, while for Cooper pair splitters based on double quantum dots, it tends to suppress both the SU(2) and SU(4) Kondo effects. Moreover, the non-local pairing induced by the superconducting proximity effect can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening, even for relatively small values of coupling to superconductivity."
