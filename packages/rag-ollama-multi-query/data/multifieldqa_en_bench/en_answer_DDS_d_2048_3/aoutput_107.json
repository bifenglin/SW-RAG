    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by employing a propagator in the latent space to represent the system's dynamics. This propagator uses a continuous complex-valued latent space to capture the reduced-order dynamics of the system. The framework treats the latent variables independently, allowing for an interpretable latent dynamics model. By solving continuous ODEs in the complex plane for each dimension of the latent variable, the framework identifies the temporal evolution in the latent space. The complex-valued latent variables and their associated parameters describe the system dynamics similar to eigenvalues, with the real part representing growth and decay and the imaginary part representing periodic components. This approach enables the framework to decompose the system's dynamics into different temporal scales, providing an interpretable representation of the reduced-order dynamics."
