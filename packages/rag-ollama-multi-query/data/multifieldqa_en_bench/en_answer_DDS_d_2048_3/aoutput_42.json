    "answer": "The relationship between the maximum velocity and the amplitude of the blob or depletion is described by a square root scaling. For small amplitudes, the velocity scales linearly with the amplitude, but for larger amplitudes, there is a transition to a square root scaling relationship. This relationship holds for both compressible and incompressible flows."
