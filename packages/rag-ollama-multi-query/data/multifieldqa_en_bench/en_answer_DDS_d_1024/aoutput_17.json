    "answer": "The function beta(r) is determined by using the vacuum Einstein equations, specifically the Baez-Bunn form of the equations. This involves considering a locally flat free-fall system around a specific event, describing a small sphere of freely floating test particles, and applying the condition that the second time derivative of the volume of the test ball must vanish. By solving the differential equations derived from this condition, the function beta(r) is determined."
