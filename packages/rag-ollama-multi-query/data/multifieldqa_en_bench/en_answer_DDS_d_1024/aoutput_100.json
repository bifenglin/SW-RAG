    "answer": "Using binary variables in the SLAS formulation helps to reduce computational complexity, making the optimization problem more manageable. This approach replaces integer variables with binary ones, allowing for faster computation times and improved efficiency in finding feasible solutions. Additionally, binary variables aid in improving the overall performance of the SLAS module by providing a more optimized and streamlined solution process."
