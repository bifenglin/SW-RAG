    "answer": "The problem encountered when building the fuselage sides is that the once straight longerons bow up from the building surface, forming a dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. This occurs when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. The curve in the top longeron is not acceptable, and no amount of clamping or brute force forming can solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction."
