    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity can greatly affect the Kondo effect. When the superconducting energy gap becomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature, it tends to suppress the Kondo effect. Moreover, the strength of the superconducting pairing can significantly influence the Kondo physics in different setups, such as enhancing the Kondo effect for QDs attached to superconducting and normal contacts, or suppressing the SU(2) and SU(4) Kondo effects for DQD-based Cooper pair splitters. Additionally, the presence of non-local pairing induced by the superconducting proximity effect can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening, even for relatively small values of coupling to superconductivity. This non-local pairing can modify the low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures."
