    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by employing a propagator in the latent space to model the system's dynamics. The latent space dynamics are represented by a continuous complex-valued ODE for each dimension of the latent variable. By solving this ODE, the operator can be defined to capture the reduced-order dynamics, where the real part represents growth and decay, and the imaginary part represents periodic components. This approach allows for the decomposition of the system's dynamics into their pertinent scales while promoting the discovery of slow processes that control the system's evolution over long time horizons. The framework uses complex-valued latent variables and a time-continuous formulation to incorporate sparse and irregularly sampled training data, allowing for fast predictions after the training phase."
