    "answer": "The transition probability of the environment affects the learning rate in the static agent by influencing how fast the network's weight vector is updated during the agent's lifetime. As the transition probability increases, the evolved learning rate also increases. However, after reaching a peak, the learning rate begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero. This indicates that as the rate of environmental transition increases, faster learning is required to speed up convergence in order to exploit the shorter stays in each environment."
