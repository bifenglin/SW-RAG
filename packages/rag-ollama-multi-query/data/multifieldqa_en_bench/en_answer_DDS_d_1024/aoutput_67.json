    "answer": "The conduction gap depends on the strain direction in a significant way. The conduction gap is strongly dependent on the direction of applied strain, with peaks occurring at specific angles of strain. The conduction gap is also influenced by the transport direction, with different directions resulting in different conduction gap values. Additionally, the relationship between the strain direction and the transport direction affects the conduction gap, with certain combinations resulting in larger conduction gaps compared to others. Overall, the conduction gap in graphene strained junctions is intricately linked to both the strain direction and the transport direction."
