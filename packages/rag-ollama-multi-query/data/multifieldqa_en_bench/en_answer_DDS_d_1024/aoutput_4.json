    "answer": "It is important for the sides of the fuselage to be sloped (tumbled home) because when the sides are sloped, the section formed is conical rather than cylindrical. This conical shape, when cut with a plane not perpendicular to its axis, results in an elliptical shape, which is what happens with the top longeron. By sloping the sides, the fuselage takes on an elliptical shape from the firewall to the tailstock, which is necessary for the proper construction of the fuselage."
