    "answer": "Some reasons for the lack of data sharing in archaeobotany include technological limitations, resistance among some archaeologists to making their data available, concerns about exposing data to scrutiny, lost opportunities of analysis before others use it, and the perception of losing the 'capital' of data. Additionally, restrictions on word counts imposed by journals, a lack of technical knowledge in making large databases available, and the wish to hold on to a dataset to optimize usage are also factors contributing to the lack of data sharing."
