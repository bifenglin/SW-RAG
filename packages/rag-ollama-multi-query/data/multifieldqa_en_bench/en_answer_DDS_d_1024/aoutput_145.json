    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE). When looking at unstandardized CPUE (individuals per set), there is a positive relationship between catch per set and factors such as number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. However, when standardizing CPUE by the number of hooks (individuals per 100 hooks per set), the relationship changes. In this case, there is a negative relationship between catch per unit effort and these fishing behavior variables, indicating diminishing returns above relatively low levels of fishing effort."
