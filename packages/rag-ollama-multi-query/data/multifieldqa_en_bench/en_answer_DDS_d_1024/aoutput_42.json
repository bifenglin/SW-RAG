    "answer": "The relationship between the maximum velocity and the amplitude of the blob or depletion is that for small amplitudes, the velocity follows a linear scaling. However, as the amplitudes increase, there is a transition to a square root scaling. This transition occurs at around a specific amplitude value for both compressible and incompressible flows. Ultimately, beyond these transition amplitudes, the velocities of compressible and incompressible blobs or depletions align."
