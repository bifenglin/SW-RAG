    "answer": "The interlayer Berry connection polarizability is significant because it has a band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability, arising from layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling. This characteristic tunability allows for the unique rectification functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems. It also plays a crucial role in the intrinsic Hall response of the twisted bilayers, providing a new tool for rectification and frequency doubling in chiral vdW bilayers."
