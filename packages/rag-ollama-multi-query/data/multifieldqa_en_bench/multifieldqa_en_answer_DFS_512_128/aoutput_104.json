    "answer": "Smartphones and tablets are different from a technical perspective in terms of power budget, connectivity, and design. Tablets have a greater power budget for SoCs, ranging up to 4W for passively cooled devices and even higher for systems with fans, allowing for a wider range of designs compared to smartphones. Additionally, tablets default to Wi-Fi connectivity rather than cellular modems, with the majority of tablets not having cellular modems at all. This results in faster time to market for tablets and they are more commonly sold directly to consumers rather than through carriers. Tablets also have reasonable-sized screens that make games and media more attractive, making them more PC-like in terms of usage models."
