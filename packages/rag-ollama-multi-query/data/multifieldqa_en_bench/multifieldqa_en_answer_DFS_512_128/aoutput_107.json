    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by using autoencoders to identify a latent space that not only represents the system's evolution over long time horizons but also quantifies predictive uncertainty and hierarchically decomposes the dynamics into their pertinent scales. This approach allows for the discovery of slow processes that control the system's evolution."
