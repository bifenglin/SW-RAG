    "answer": "The main focus of the research paper is to study lattice QCD in the dual formulation, specifically in the strong coupling regime and at leading order of the strong coupling expansion. The paper aims to provide insights into mechanisms such as confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, restoration at the chiral transition temperature, and the nuclear liquid gas transition. The research also involves performing Monte Carlo simulations in the dual formulation with large quark masses to establish a region of overlap of effective theories. The paper discusses the setup of the simulations, the dependence on quark mass and beta, and concludes by comparing the results with other findings."
