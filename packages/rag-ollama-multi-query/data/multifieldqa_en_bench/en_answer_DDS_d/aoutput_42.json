    "answer": "The relationship between the maximum velocity and the amplitude of the blob or depletion is given by Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vmax_theo}. This equation provides a concise expression that captures both the linear scaling and the square root scaling of the maximum velocity in compressible flows."
