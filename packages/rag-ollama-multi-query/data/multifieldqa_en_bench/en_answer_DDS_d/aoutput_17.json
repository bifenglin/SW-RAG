    "answer": "The function beta(r) is determined in the derivation by using the vacuum Einstein equations in the form provided by Baez and Bunn. The equations relate to the volume of a test ball of freely floating test particles in a locally flat free-fall system. By analyzing the change in distance between particles in the radial and transversal directions over time, a differential equation is derived that leads to the function beta(r) being expressed as sqrt(2GM/(rc^2)), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, r is the radial coordinate, and c is the speed of light. This function is then used to simplify the metric to obtain the Schwarzschild solution."
