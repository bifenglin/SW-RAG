    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by influencing the speed at which the bubble moves. Specifically, it was found that in the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the average motion. However, when the shock wave passes through the bubble, a larger specific-heat ratio speeds up the average motion of the bubbles. This is because bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratios need more energy to compress their size, resulting in slower translational energy."
