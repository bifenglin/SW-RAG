    "answer": "The vacuum processing system is configured with multiple vacuum processing apparatus arranged in parallel. Each vacuum processing apparatus consists of an air loader with cassette stands and a carrier for wafer transfer, a vacuum loader with etching treatment chambers and a vacuum carriage chamber connected through gate valves, and a lock device with load lock chambers and unload lock chambers for connecting the carrier with the vacuum carriage chamber. The etching treatment chambers are symmetrically arranged about the axis passing through the center of the vacuum carriage chamber, with two chambers provided only on the opposite side of the vacuum carriage chamber and positioned at an acute angle."
