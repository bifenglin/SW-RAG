    "answer": "In the numerical experiments, the runtimes and iteration counts of NFPA and FPSA are significantly lower compared to GMRES and DSA. Both NFPA and FPSA outperformed GMRES and DSA by orders of magnitude in terms of runtime and iterations for all cases tested. Additionally, NFPA and FPSA showed similar performance in terms of runtime and iterations, with NFPA even outperforming FPSA in iteration count for one of the problems tested."
