    "answer": "The interlayer Berry connection polarizability is significant because it has a band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection. It arises from the layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling and allows for a unique rectification functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems. The interlayer Berry connection polarizability plays a crucial role in generating the crossed nonlinear dynamical intrinsic Hall effect in twisted bilayers."
