    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system is demonstrated by their ability to achieve higher similarity scores than CNNs with the same depth and almost the same architectures. SNNs outperform their counterparts of CNNs in neural representation similarity experiments, showing that SNNs could serve as promising candidates to better model and explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system."
