    "answer": "The ISR (Integrated Stress Response) is not necessary for transgene reactivation in response to EAA (essential amino acid) starvation. This conclusion is supported by the findings that the ISR pathway, including the downstream effector CHOP, is activated upon EAA starvation but does not fully correlate with transgene reactivation. Additionally, experiments using Salubrinal to induce the ISR, ISRIB to inhibit the ISR, and knockdown of ATF4 (a downstream effector of the ISR) did not interfere with transgene reactivation in response to EAA starvation. Therefore, the ISR pathway is not essential for transgene reactivation in this context."
