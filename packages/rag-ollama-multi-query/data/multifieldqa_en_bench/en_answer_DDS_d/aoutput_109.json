    "answer": "The electron correlation parameter, $\\Gamma_e$, is the ratio of the average unscreened electron-electron potential energy to the electron kinetic energy. It is defined by the equation $\\Gamma_e = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 a_{ws}}\\frac{1}{k_B T_e}$, where $a_{ws}$ is the Wigner-Seitz radius related to the electron density, and $T_e$ is the electron temperature."
