    "answer": "The stability conditions for a solution of $-\\Delta u = f(u)$ are given by the inequality:\n\n\\[ \\int f'(u) \\psi^2 \\le \\int | \\nabla \\psi|^2, \\quad \\forall \\psi \\in C_c^2 \\]\n\nwhere $f'(u)$ is the derivative of the non-linearity function $f(u)$, and $C_c^2$ is the set of $C^2$ functions defined on ${\\mathbb{R}}^N$ with compact support."
