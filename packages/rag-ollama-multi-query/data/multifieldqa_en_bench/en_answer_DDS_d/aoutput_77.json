    "answer": "The receptive field size affects the completion of shapes by influencing the algorithm's capability to fill in bigger gap sizes. The experiment results showed that the bigger the receptive field size, the more successful the algorithm is in filling in the gaps in shapes. This indicates that models with bigger receptive field sizes can complete shapes with bigger gaps more effectively."
