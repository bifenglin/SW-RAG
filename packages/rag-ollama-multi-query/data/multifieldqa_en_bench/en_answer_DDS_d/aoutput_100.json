    "answer": "Using binary variables in the SLAS formulation helps to reduce computational complexity, making the optimization problem more manageable. This approach replaces integer variables with binary ones and aids in improving numerical computations. It allows for faster execution and optimization, making the SLAS module more efficient and suitable for real-time applications."
