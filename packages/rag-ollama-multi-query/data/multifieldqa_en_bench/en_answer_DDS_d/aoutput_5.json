    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity has a significant effect on the Kondo effect. It can suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap becomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature. Moreover, the strength of superconducting pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics, enhancing the Kondo effect for certain setups while tending to suppress it in others, such as DQD-based Cooper pair splitters. In the presence of superconductivity, phenomena like the two-stage Kondo screening and the generation of the Kondo singlet through the CAR exchange mechanism are observed. This shows that superconductivity plays a crucial role in modifying the low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures."
