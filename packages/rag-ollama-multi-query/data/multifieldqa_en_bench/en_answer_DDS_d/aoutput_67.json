    "answer": "The conduction gap depends on the strain direction in a significant way. The conduction gap is strongly dependent on the direction of applied strain, with peaks occurring at specific angles of strain. Specifically, the conduction gap peaks occur at certain angles of strain, such as approximately 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 47 degrees, and 133 degrees for tensile strain, and 43 degrees and 137 degrees for compressive strain. The conduction gap can be zero at certain angles of strain as well. The direction of strain plays a crucial role in determining the magnitude of the conduction gap in graphene strained junctions."
