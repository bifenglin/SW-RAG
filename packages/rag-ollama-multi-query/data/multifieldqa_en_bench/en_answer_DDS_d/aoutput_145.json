    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE) as indicated in the context. Unstandardized CPUE was significantly lower in January and in West Nusa Tenggara Province. Engine power had a significant positive influence on unstandardized CPUE. Surface longlines had a higher unstandardized CPUE than bottom longlines. However, when standardizing CPUE for the number of hooks, the relationship was reversed, with bottom longlines exhibiting a higher standardize CPUE. This suggests that there are diminishing returns for increasing fishing effort above low to moderate levels, leading to a decrease in catch per unit effort."
