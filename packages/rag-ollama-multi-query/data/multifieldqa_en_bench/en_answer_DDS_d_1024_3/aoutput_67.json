    "answer": "The conduction gap is strongly dependent on the strain direction. Peaks in the conduction gap occur at specific angles of strain, such as $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$ for tensile strain, and different angles for compressive strain. The conduction gap is also influenced by the direction of applied strain and the transport direction. Additionally, the conduction gap is different for different transport directions, such as armchair and zigzag, and shows a continuous shift in behavior when varying the transport direction."
