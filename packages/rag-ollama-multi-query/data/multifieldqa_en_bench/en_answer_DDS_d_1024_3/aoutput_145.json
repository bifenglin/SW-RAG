    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE) in the Tanjung Luar shark fishery. When looking at unstandardized CPUE (individuals per set), there is a positive relationship with the number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. However, when standardizing CPUE by the number of hooks (individuals per 100 hooks per set), the relationships are reversed. This means that while increasing fishing effort initially increases total catch, there are diminishing returns above low to moderate levels of effort."
