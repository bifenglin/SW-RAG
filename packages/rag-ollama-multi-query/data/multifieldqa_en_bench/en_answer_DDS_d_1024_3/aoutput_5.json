    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity can have several effects on the Kondo effect. One major effect is the suppression of the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap becomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature. Additionally, the strength of the superconducting pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics, enhancing or suppressing the Kondo effect depending on the specific setup. In the presence of superconductivity, the low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures can be greatly modified. Moreover, the non-local pairing induced by the superconducting proximity effect, which gives rise to the crossed Andreev reflections (CAR) exchange mechanism, can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening. This effect occurs even for relatively small values of coupling to the superconductor, leading to modifications in the Kondo physics."
