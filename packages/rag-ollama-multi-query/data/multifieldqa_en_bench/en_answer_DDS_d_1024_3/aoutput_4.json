    "answer": "It is important for the sides of the fuselage to be sloped (tumbled home) because if the sides were not sloped, the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. However, since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane not perpendicular to its axis, the shape formed is elliptical. This tumbling home shape is necessary to avoid creating an elliptical shape in the fuselage."
