    "answer": "Decorrelating the data before running the PLS algorithm improves its performance by making the PLS algorithm significantly better for a small number of components. This results in a better correlation between the true values on the test set and their prediction, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the ensemble-weighted maximally correlated mode."
