    "answer": "The relationship between the maximum velocity and the amplitude of the blob or depletion is described by Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vmax_theo} in the context provided. This equation predicts the maximum velocity based on the amplitude of the blob or depletion, capturing both linear scaling and square root scaling behavior for different amplitudes."
