    "answer": "Some reasons for the lack of data sharing in archaeobotany include technological limitations, resistance amongst some archaeologists to making their data available due to concerns about scrutiny, lost opportunities for analysis before others use it, and the desire to hold onto data to optimize usage. Additionally, there may be restrictions on word counts imposed by journals, a lack of technical knowledge in making large databases available, and the emphasis on creating new data through archaeological research, which may lead to a perception that the reuse of previously published datasets is not valuable."
