    "answer": "The function beta(r) is determined by using the vacuum Einstein equations, specifically the Baez-Bunn form of the vacuum Einstein equation. This equation relates the second derivative of the volume of a test ball to zero, which leads to a differential equation for beta(r). By solving this differential equation and considering the Newtonian limit at large distances, the value of beta(r) is obtained."
