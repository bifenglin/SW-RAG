    "answer": "The interlayer Berry connection polarizability is significant because it has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability. It arises from layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling and allows for a unique rectification functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems."
