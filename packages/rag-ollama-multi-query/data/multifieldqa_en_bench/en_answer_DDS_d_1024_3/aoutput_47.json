    "answer": "The problem encountered when building the fuselage sides is that the completed fuselage sides, when laid into position to form the fuselage box section, have straight longerons that bow up from the building surface, forming a dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. This issue arises when the sides, which were built flat, are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section, resulting in an elliptical shape in the top longeron."
