    "answer": "The electron correlation parameter, $\\Gamma_e$, is defined as the ratio of the average unscreened electron-electron potential energy to the electron kinetic energy, given by the equation: \n\n\\[ \\Gamma_e = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 a_{ws}} \\frac{1}{k_B T_e} \\]\n\nwhere $a_{ws}$ is the Wigner-Seitz radius, related to the electron density by $\\rho_e = 1/\\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\pi a_{ws}^3\\right)$."
