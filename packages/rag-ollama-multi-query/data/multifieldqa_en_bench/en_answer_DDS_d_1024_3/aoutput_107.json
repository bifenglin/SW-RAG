    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by employing a propagator in the complex-valued latent space to capture the dynamics of the system. This is done by using continuous ODEs in the complex plane for each dimension of the latent variable. By solving these ODEs, the operator is defined, allowing for the identification of the reduced dynamics in the latent space. Additionally, the framework uses complex numbers in the latent space to describe the system dynamics, similar to eigenvalues, where the real part represents growth and decay, and the imaginary part represents periodic components. This approach allows for the incorporation of sparse and irregularly sampled training data and directly relies on complex numbers in the latent space to capture the reduced-order dynamics."
