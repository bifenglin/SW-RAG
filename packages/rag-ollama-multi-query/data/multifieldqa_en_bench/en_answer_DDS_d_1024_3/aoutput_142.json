    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by influencing the energy needed to compress the bubble. A larger specific-heat ratio speeds up the average motion of the bubble, while a smaller specific-heat ratio results in slower average motion. This is because bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratios need more energy to compress their size, leading to lower translational energy and slower average motion."
