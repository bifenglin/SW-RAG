    "answer": "The function beta(r) is determined in the derivation by exploiting the symmetries of the solutions and the properties of infalling observers, as well as using the vacuum Einstein equations that link the matter content with the geometry of spacetime. The function beta(r) is the only unknown function of one variable in the metric and is obtained by analyzing the spacetime metric outside a spherically-symmetric matter distribution through the application of the vacuum Einstein equations."
