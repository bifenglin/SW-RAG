    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system lies in their ability to yield brain-like representations by capturing the dynamics of biological neurons, extracting spatio-temporal features, and encoding information with spikes. Deep SNNs have shown promising results in fitting complex biological neural representations, outperforming CNNs in various experiments. Additionally, SNNs have the potential to shed light on the visual processing mechanisms in both macaques and mice, providing new insights into the differences and similarities between the two species' visual cortex. Ultimately, SNNs may serve as a novel and powerful tool for research on the visual system, offering a more biologically plausible approach to studying vision systems."
