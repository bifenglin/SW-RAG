    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE). When looking at unstandardised CPUE (individuals per set), there is a positive relationship with the number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. However, when CPUE is standardised by hook number (individuals per 100 hooks per set), the relationships are reversed. In this case, there is a negative relationship between CPUE and the fishing behavior variables such as the number of hooks, number of sets, and engine power. This difference in relationships highlights the importance of using appropriate standardisation for meaningful comparisons of CPUE across different gears and vessel types in fisheries management."
