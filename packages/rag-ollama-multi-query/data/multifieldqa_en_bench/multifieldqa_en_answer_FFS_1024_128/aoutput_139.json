    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system is significant, as they have shown promise in better modeling and explaining the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system. They have been successful at predicting neural responses in the primate visual cortex, matching the hierarchy of the ventral visual stream, and even controlling neural activity. Additionally, SNNs are capable of encoding information with spikes, capturing the dynamics of biological neurons, and extracting spatio-temporal features, making them highly possible to yield brain-like representations."
