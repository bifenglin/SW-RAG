    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE) as indicated by the positive relationship between unstandardized CPUE (individuals per set) and number of hooks, number of sets, and engine power. However, there is a negative relationship between CPUE and these fishing behavior variables when CPUE is standardized by hook number (individuals per 100 hooks per set)."
