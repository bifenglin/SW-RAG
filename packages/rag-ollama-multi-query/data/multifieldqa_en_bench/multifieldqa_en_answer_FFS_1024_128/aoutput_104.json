    "answer": "Smartphones are more compact and power-constrained compared to tablets. Smartphone SoCs are limited to around 1W, while tablet SoCs can have a power budget of up to 4W for passively cooled devices and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans. Additionally, smartphones typically have cellular modems integrated into the SoC, while tablets default to Wi-Fi connectivity and do not always have cellular modems."
