    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it allows for a unique rectification functionality and transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems. It also leads to the development of a dc Hall current that can be controlled by the phase difference of two driving fields, without affecting the magnitude of the double-frequency component. This characteristic tunability makes it a unique approach for studying chiral bilayers and their transport properties."
