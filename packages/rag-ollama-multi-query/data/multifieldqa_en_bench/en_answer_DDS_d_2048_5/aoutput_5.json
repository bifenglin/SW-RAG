    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity can have various effects on the Kondo effect. Here are some of the effects mentioned in the context:\n\n1. The presence of superconductivity can suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap becomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature.\n2. The strength of superconducting pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in different scenarios, such as enhancing the Kondo effect for QDs attached to superconducting and normal contacts, while tending to suppress the $SU(2)$ and $SU(4)$ Kondo effects for DQD-based Cooper pair splitters.\n3. The non-local pairing induced by the superconducting proximity effect can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening, leading to modifications in the low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures.\n4. The CAR exchange mechanism induced by the superconducting proximity effect can greatly modify the Kondo physics in multi-impurity systems, even in the absence of other exchange mechanisms."
