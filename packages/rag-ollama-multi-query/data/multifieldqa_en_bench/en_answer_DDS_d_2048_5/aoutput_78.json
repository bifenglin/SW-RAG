    "answer": "The interlayer Berry connection polarizability is significant because it has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of the interlayer Berry connection. It arises from the layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling in twisted bilayers. This quantity plays a crucial role in generating a unique rectification functionality and serves as a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems."
