    "answer": "Smartphones and tablets are different from a technical perspective in terms of power constraints, connectivity, and design. Smartphones are more compact and power-constrained, limited to around 1W by batteries and thermal dissipation. They require a cellular modem for connectivity, with the modem often integrated into the SoC itself for cost-sensitive models. Smartphones also have a walled-garden aspect, with carriers controlling device approval and sales. On the other hand, tablets have higher power budgets, up to 4W for passively cooled devices and 7-8W for systems with fans. They typically use Wi-Fi for connectivity instead of a cellular modem and are more PC-like in terms of usage models. Tablets are sold directly to consumers and offer a wider range of designs compared to smartphones."
