    "answer": "The conduction gap is strongly dependent on the strain direction. Peaks and zero values of the conduction gap occur at specific angles of strain, such as around 47 degrees and 133 degrees for tensile strain and around 43 degrees and 137 degrees for compressive strain. The conduction gap peaks are different for different strain directions, and the relationship between the strain angle and the conduction gap is not linear. The conduction gap is also affected by the transport direction, with the preferred transport directions being close to the armchair direction to achieve a larger conduction gap. Different strain directions and transport directions result in different conduction gap values."
