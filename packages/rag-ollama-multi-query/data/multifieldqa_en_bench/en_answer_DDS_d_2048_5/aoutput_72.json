    "answer": "In the numerical experiments, both NFPA and FPSA showed significantly better performance in terms of runtime and iteration counts compared to GMRES and DSA. NFPA and FPSA outperformed GMRES and DSA by orders of magnitude in terms of runtime. Additionally, NFPA and FPSA required fewer iterations to converge compared to GMRES and DSA, showing that they are more efficient and effective methods for solving the transport equation in the given context."
