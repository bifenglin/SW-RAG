    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE) because when controlling for the number of hooks used, the standardised CPUE of bottom longlines is significantly higher than that of surface longlines. This suggests that the effectiveness of fishing gear in relation to catch per unit effort changes when standardising for the number of hooks deployed."
