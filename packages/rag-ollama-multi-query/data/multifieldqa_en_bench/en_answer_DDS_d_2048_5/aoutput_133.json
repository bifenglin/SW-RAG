    "answer": "The advantage of decorrelating the data before running the PLS algorithm is that it improves the performance of the algorithm, especially for a small number of components. By estimating the covariance matrix to decorrelate the data, the PLS algorithm performs significantly better, resulting in improved correlations between the true values and predictions. This approach helps in identifying the atomic dynamics relevant for the response variable, leading to more accurate and robust results."
