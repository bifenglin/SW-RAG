    "answer": "The transition probability of the environment affects the learning rate in the static agent by increasing the learning rate as the transition probability increases. Initially, the learning rate rises as the transition probability increases from 0, reaching a peak and then declining slowly before eventually reaching zero. This indicates that as the rate of environmental transition increases, faster learning is required to speed up convergence in order to exploit the shorter stays in each environment."
