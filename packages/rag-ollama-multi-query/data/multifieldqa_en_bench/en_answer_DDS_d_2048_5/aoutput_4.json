    "answer": "The sides of the fuselage need to be sloped (tumbled home) in order to form a conical section when building the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped, the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lay flat. By sloping the sides, the section formed is conical, which results in the longerons taking on an elliptical shape. This is necessary for the proper construction and shaping of the fuselage."
