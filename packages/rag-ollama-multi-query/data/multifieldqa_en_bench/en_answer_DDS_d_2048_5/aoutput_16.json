    "answer": "The main methodology used in the research is based on emergent communication, which studies the creation of an artificial language to encode high task-utility messages directly from data. The research proposes an unsupervised method based on the information bottleneck to capture both referential complexity and task-specific utility to adequately explore sparse social communication scenarios in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The methodology focuses on developing a natural-language-inspired lexicon of messages that is independently composed of a set of emergent concepts, aligning action policies of heterogeneous agents, and learning a communication policy through a process called 'social shadowing'."
