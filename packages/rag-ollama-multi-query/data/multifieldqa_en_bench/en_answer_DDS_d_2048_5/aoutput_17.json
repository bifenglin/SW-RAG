    "answer": "The function beta(r) is determined in the derivation by using the simplified form of the vacuum Einstein equations, specifically the equation that describes the volume of a test ball of freely falling particles. By analyzing the motion of these test particles in the spherically symmetric, static spacetime, the differential equation for beta(r) is derived and solved through integration to obtain the final form of the function beta(r)."
