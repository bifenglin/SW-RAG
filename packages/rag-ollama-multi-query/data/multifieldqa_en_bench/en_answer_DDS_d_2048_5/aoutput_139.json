    "answer": "The potential of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in modeling the visual system is significant. The study shows that SNNs achieve higher similarity scores than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the same depth and almost the same architectures. SNNs outperform CNNs in neural representation similarity experiments, indicating that they could serve as promising candidates to better model and explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system. The study suggests that SNNs could be a novel and powerful tool for research on the visual system, providing new insights into the visual processing mechanisms of different species, such as macaques and mice."
