    "answer": "Smartphones are more compact and power constrained compared to tablets. Smartphone SoCs are limited to around 1W, while tablets have a much greater power budget, up to 4W for a passively cooled device and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans. Additionally, smartphones require a cellular modem as an absolute necessity, while tablets default to Wi-Fi connectivity instead of a cellular modem. Tablets also have a wider range of designs compared to smartphones, as they do not have the same power and size constraints. The software ecosystem for smartphones and tablets is relatively similar, with major OSes like iOS, Android, and Windows available for both devices."
