    "answer": "The potential of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in modeling the visual system is that they achieve higher similarity scores than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the same depth and almost the same architectures. SNNs outperform CNNs in neural representation similarity experiments and are considered promising candidates for better modeling and explaining the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system."
