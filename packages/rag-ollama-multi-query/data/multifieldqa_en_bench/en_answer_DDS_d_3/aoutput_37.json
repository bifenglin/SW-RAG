    "answer": "The stability conditions for a solution of $-\\Delta u = f(u)$ are given by the inequality:\n\n\\[ \\int f'(u) \\psi^2 \\le \\int | \\nabla \\psi|^2, \\quad \\forall \\psi \\in C_c^2 \\] \n\nThis condition states that a solution $u$ is stable if the second variation at $u$ of the energy associated with the equation is non-negative."
