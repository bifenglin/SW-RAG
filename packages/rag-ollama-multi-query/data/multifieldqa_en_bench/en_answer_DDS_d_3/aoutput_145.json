    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE) because, while there is a positive relationship between unstandardized CPUE (individuals per set) and factors such as number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets, there is a significant negative relationship between standardizes CPUE (individuals per 100 hooks per set) and these same fishing behavior variables. This indicates that there are diminishing returns as fishing effort increases above low to moderate levels, leading to decreased catch per unit effort."
