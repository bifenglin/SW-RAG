    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it plays a crucial role in the geometric origin of the crossed nonlinear dynamical intrinsic Hall effect in twisted bilayers. It contributes to the generation of a unique rectification functionality and serves as a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems. The interlayer Berry connection polarizability arises from the layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling, and it allows for the emergence of intrinsic Hall currents under the joint action of in-plane and out-of-plane electric fields."
