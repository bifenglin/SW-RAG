    "answer": "No, the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is not necessary for transgene reactivation. This was demonstrated by the fact that inhibiting the ISR pathway, specifically by blocking the phosphorylation of eIF2Î±, did not induce transgene reactivation. Additionally, knockdown of the downstream effector ATF4, which is part of the ISR pathway, also did not affect transgene reactivation."
