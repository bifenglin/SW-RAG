    "answer": "The proposed approach in this research paper is to provide a probabilistic interpretation of the least-mean-square (LMS) filter. This interpretation leads to the development of an adaptable step-size LMS algorithm that performs well in both stationary and tracking scenarios. The algorithm has fewer parameters compared to previous approaches and these parameters have clear physical meanings. Additionally, the probabilistic model used in this approach allows for easy extensibility to incorporate various Bayesian machine learning techniques in adaptive filtering."
