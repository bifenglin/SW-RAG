    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by employing a non-linear autoencoder architecture combined with a time-continuous model for the latent dynamics in a complex space. This approach allows for the inclusion of sparse and irregularly sampled training data. The learned latent dynamics are interpretable and reveal the different temporal scales involved in the system. By using a complex-valued latent space, the framework can incorporate harmonic effects and reduce the number of latent variables needed. Additionally, the framework unifies the tasks of dimensionality reduction and discovery of reduced dynamics, optimizing both the autoencoder and latent dynamics simultaneously."
