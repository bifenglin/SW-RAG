    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity can have various effects on the Kondo effect in quantum dot systems. Some of the effects include:\n\n1. Suppression of the Kondo effect: If the energy gap of the superconductivity becomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature, the Kondo effect can be suppressed.\n\n2. Enhancement of the Kondo effect: For quantum dots attached to both superconducting and normal contacts, the superconducting pairing can enhance the Kondo effect.\n\n3. Modification of the Kondo physics: For DQD-based Cooper pair splitters, the superexchange induced by superconductivity tends to suppress both the SU(2) and SU(4) Kondo effects.\n\n4. Emergence of the crossed Andreev reflections (CAR) exchange mechanism: The presence of superconductivity induces non-local pairing in quantum dots, leading to the CAR exchange mechanism, which can significantly modify the low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures. \n\nOverall, the proximity of superconductivity can play a crucial role in altering the Kondo effect in quantum dot systems."
