    "answer": "The transition probability of the environment affects the learning rate in the static agent by increasing the learning rate as the transition probability increases. The learning rate rapidly rises as the transition probability is increased, peaks, and then begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero. This means that as the rate of environmental transition increases, faster learning is required to speed up convergence in order to exploit the shorter stays in each environment."
