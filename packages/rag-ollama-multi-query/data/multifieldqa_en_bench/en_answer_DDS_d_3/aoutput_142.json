    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by influencing the energy required for compression. A larger specific-heat ratio speeds up the average motion of the bubble because bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratios need more energy to compress, resulting in lower translational energy and slower motion."
