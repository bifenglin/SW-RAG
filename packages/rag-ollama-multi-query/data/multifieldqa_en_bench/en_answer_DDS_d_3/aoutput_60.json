    "answer": "The performance of the PLM with decimation is better compared to other methods, such as the PLM with $l_2$ regularization and a mean-field-based method. The PLM with decimation shows higher precision in problems where the underlying interaction network is sparse, providing more accurate network reconstructions by identifying and setting to zero very weak bonds. Additionally, the PLM with decimation allows for a precise estimate of the total number of bonds by identifying the number of decimated bonds at which the tilted pseudo-likelihood is maximum. In terms of reconstruction error, the PLM with decimation significantly outperforms other methods, enhancing the minimum of the reconstruction error by almost an order of magnitude. Overall, the PLM with decimation shows superior performance in network reconstruction compared to other techniques."
