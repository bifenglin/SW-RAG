    "answer": "The relationship between the maximum velocity and the amplitude of the blob or depletion is that for small amplitudes, the velocities follow a linear scaling. As the amplitudes increase, there is a transition to a square root scaling. Beyond certain amplitudes, the velocities of compressible and incompressible blobs or depletions align."
