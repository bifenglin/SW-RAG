    "answer": "In the numerical experiments, the runtimes and iteration counts of NFPA and FPSA were significantly lower compared to GMRES and DSA for all cases. Both NFPA and FPSA outperformed GMRES and DSA by orders of magnitude in terms of runtime and iterations. Additionally, NFPA and FPSA showed similar performance in terms of runtime and iteration counts, with NFPA sometimes outperforming FPSA in iteration count for certain problems."
