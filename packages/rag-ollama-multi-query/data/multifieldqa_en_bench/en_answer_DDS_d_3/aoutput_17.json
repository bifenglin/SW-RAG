    "answer": "The function beta(r) is determined in the derivation by using the vacuum Einstein equations, specifically the Baez-Bunn form, which relate the matter content with the geometry of spacetime. The equations describe a locally flat free-fall system and state that the second time derivative of the volume of a test ball must be zero. By applying these equations to a set of test particles in the spacetime model, the function beta(r) is derived up to two integration constants. The analysis involves considering the motion of the test particles and their initial conditions, leading to differential equations for beta(r) that are solved using separation of variables and integration. The final result for beta(r) is obtained by fixing the integration constants based on the initial conditions for the infalling observers and the Newtonian limit at large distances from the center of symmetry."
