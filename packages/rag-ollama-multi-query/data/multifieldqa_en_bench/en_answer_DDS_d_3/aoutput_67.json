    "answer": "The conduction gap depends on the strain direction in the graphene strained junctions. The conduction gap is strongly dependent on both the strain strength and the direction of applied strain. Peaks and zero values of the conduction gap occur at specific strain directions, which vary depending on whether the strain is tensile or compressive. The conduction gap can reach a maximum value with a certain strain direction, and the preferred strain direction for achieving a large conduction gap may differ based on whether the transport direction is along the armchair or zigzag direction. Overall, the conduction gap in graphene strained junctions is influenced by the strain direction, and different strain directions can result in varying levels of conduction gap."
