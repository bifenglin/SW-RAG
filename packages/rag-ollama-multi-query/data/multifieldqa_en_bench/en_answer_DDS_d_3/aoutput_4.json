    "answer": "The sides of the fuselage need to be sloped (tumbled home) in order to form a conical section when the sides are bent and sloped. If the sides were not sloped, the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. By sloping the sides, the section formed is conical, which results in the longerons taking on an elliptical shape when bent to form the fuselage box section."
