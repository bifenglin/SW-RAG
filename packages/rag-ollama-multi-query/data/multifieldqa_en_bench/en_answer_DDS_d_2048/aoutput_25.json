    "answer": "The transition probability of the environment affects the learning rate in the static agent by influencing how fast the network's weight vector is updated during the lifetime of the agents. Specifically, as the transition probability increases, the evolved learning rate decreases. This means that agents opt for slower learning when the environmental transition is more frequent."
