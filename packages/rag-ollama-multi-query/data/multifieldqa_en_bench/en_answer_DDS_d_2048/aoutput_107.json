    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by employing a propagator in the latent space to capture the system's dynamics in a reduced form. This propagator uses complex-valued latent variables and treats them independently, allowing for interpretable latent dynamics. The approach involves using a continuous ODE in the complex plane for each dimension of the latent variable to describe the temporal evolution. By solving this ODE, the framework defines an operator that captures the reduced dynamics in the latent space, similar to the role of an eigenvalue in describing system dynamics. This method allows for the incorporation of sparse and irregularly sampled training data and directly relies on complex numbers in the latent space to capture the system's reduced-order dynamics effectively."
