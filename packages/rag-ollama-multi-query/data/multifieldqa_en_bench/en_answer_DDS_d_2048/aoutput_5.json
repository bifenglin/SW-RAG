    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity has a significant effect on the Kondo effect. Specifically, the presence of superconductivity can lead to the occurrence of the two-stage Kondo screening even in the absence of other exchange mechanisms. The superconductivity-induced effect, known as the crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) exchange, can modify the low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures. Furthermore, the competition between CAR exchange and the conventional RKKY interaction can result in different Kondo screening scenarios, highlighting the complex interplay between superconductivity and the Kondo effect."
