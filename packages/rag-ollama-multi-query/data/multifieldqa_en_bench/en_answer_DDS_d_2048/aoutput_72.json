    "answer": "In the numerical experiments, the runtimes and iteration counts of NFPA and FPSA are significantly lower compared to GMRES and DSA. NFPA and FPSA outperformed GMRES and DSA by orders of magnitude in both runtime and iterations for all cases tested with different scattering kernels. The results showed that NFPA and FPSA were more efficient and converged faster than GMRES and DSA in solving the transport equation with highly forward-peaked scattering."
