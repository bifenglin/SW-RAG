    "answer": "The stability conditions for a solution of $-\\Delta u = f(u)$ are given by the inequality:\n\n\\[ \\int \\omega_2 f'(u) \\psi^2 \\le \\int \\omega_1 | \\nabla \\psi|^2, \\quad \\forall \\psi \\in C_c^2, \\]\n\nwhere $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ are smooth positive functions that satisfy certain growth conditions at infinity."
