    "answer": "No, the ISR (Integrated Stress Response) is not necessary for transgene reactivation in response to EAA (essential amino acid) starvation. This was demonstrated by experiments where the ISR was activated by Salubrinal, a drug that induces the ISR by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of eIF2Î±, and by using the chemical compound ISRIB, which inhibits the activation of the ISR. In both cases, the reactivation of the transgenes was not affected, indicating that the ISR is neither sufficient nor necessary to induce transgene reactivation."
