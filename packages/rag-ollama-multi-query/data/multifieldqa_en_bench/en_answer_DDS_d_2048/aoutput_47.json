    "answer": "The problem encountered when building the fuselage sides is that the once straight longerons become bowed up from the building surface, forming a dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. This issue arises when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. The curve in the top longeron is not acceptable, especially when using preformed fiberglass parts. No amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem, and the builder is left wondering what went wrong."
