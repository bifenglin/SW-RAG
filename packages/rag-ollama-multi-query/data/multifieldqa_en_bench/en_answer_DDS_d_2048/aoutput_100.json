    "answer": "Using binary variables in the SLAS formulation helps to reduce computational complexity by replacing integer variables. This reformulation aids in improving the efficiency of the optimization process, making it quicker to find feasible solutions. Additionally, binary variables allow for the implementation of lazy constraints, further enhancing computational efficiency by finding feasible solutions without including certain constraints until necessary. Overall, the use of binary variables in the SLAS formulation helps to optimize the decision-making process and improve the performance of the autonomous vehicle navigation system."
