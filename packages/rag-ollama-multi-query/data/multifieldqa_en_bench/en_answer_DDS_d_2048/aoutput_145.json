    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE). For unstandardized CPUE (individuals per set), there is a positive relationship with factors such as number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. However, when CPUE is standardized by the number of hooks (individuals per 100 hooks per set), the relationships are reversed. This indicates that the effort for catching sharks in the fishery exceeds the maximum sustainable level, leading to diminishing returns as more effort is added."
