    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system is highlighted by their ability to achieve higher similarity scores compared to CNNs in neural representation similarity experiments. SNNs have shown promising results in fitting complex biological neural representations and exploring the biological visual cortex, making them a novel and powerful tool for research on the visual system."
