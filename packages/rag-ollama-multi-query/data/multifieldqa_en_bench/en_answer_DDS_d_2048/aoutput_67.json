    "answer": "The conduction gap depends on the strain direction such that the conduction gap peaks occur at specific angles of strain direction. For example, in the case of tensile strain, the conduction gap peaks occur at approximately 0 degrees and 90 degrees, while for compressive strain, the peaks occur at around 43 degrees and 137 degrees. The conduction gap is also affected by the transport direction and the relationship between the strain and transport directions determines the behavior of the conduction gap."
