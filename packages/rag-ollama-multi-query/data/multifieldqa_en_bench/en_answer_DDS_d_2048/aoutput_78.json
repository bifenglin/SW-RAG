    "answer": "The interlayer Berry connection polarizability is significant because it has a band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of the interlayer Berry connection. This polarizability arises from the layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling. It allows for a unique rectification functionality and serves as a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems."
