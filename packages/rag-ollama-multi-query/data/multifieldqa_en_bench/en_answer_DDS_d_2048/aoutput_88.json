    "answer": "The proposed approach in this research paper is to provide a probabilistic interpretation of the least-mean-square (LMS) filter. This results in an adaptable step-size LMS algorithm that performs well in both stationary and tracking scenarios. The algorithm has fewer free parameters compared to previous approaches, and these parameters have clear physical meanings."
