    "answer": "To level up in the early levels of the game, you need to prove your loyalty to your Faction by earning experience points (XP). This can be done by deploying nanobots, harvesting your bases, and participating in battles to capture zones. As you gain more XP, you will level up quickly and unlock access to more options and abilities in the game."
