    "answer": "Smartphones are more compact and power constrained compared to tablets. Smartphone SoCs are limited to around 1W, both by batteries and thermal dissipation. Smartphones require a cellular modem, which is an absolute necessity, and for cost-sensitive models, the modem is integrated into the SoC itself. On the other hand, tablets are more akin to PCs both technically and economically. Tablet SoCs have a much greater power budget, up to 4W for passively cooled devices and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans. Tablets default to Wi-Fi connectivity rather than a cellular modem, and cellular modems are almost always optional discrete components of the platform. Tablets have a wider range of designs compared to smartphones due to their power budget."
