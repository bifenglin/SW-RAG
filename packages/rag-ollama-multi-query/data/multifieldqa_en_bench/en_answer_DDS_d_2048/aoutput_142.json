    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by influencing its compressibility. Bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratios move slower on average because they require more energy to compress their size, resulting in lower translational energy. Therefore, bubbles with larger specific-heat ratios move faster on average as they do not need as much energy to compress."
