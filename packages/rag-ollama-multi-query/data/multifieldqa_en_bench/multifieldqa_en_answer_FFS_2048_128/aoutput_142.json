    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by speeding it up when the shock wave passes through the bubble (t > 0.03). Bubbles with a larger specific-heat ratio experience faster average motion because they need less energy to compress their size compared to bubbles with a smaller specific-heat ratio."
