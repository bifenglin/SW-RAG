    "answer": "The interlayer Berry connection polarizability is significant because it has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl, and it allows for the development of a dc Hall current that can be controlled by the phase difference of two driving fields. This characteristic tunability makes it a unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers."
