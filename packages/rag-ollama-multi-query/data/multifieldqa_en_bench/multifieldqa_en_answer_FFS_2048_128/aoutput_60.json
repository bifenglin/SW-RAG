    "answer": "The performance of the PLM with decimation is significantly better than other methods, such as the PLM with $l_2$-regularization and a mean-field technique, especially for lower sample sizes. It is able to reproduce the original network even when the sample size is equal to the number of variables, indicating its effectiveness in under-sampling regimes. Additionally, the reconstruction error obtained with the PLM with decimation is consistently smaller than that of other techniques across all temperatures and sample sizes."
