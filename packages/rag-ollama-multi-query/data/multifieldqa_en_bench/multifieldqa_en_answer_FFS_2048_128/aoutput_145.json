    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables differ when considering different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE). When looking at unstandardized CPUE (individuals per set), there is a positive association with the number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. However, when controlling for hook number using standardized CPUE (individuals per 100 hooks per set), the relationships are reversed, with standardized CPUE of bottom longlines being significantly higher than that of surface longlines. This pattern is also observed when comparing relationships between CPUE (individuals per set) and standardized CPUE for other measures of fishing effort, such as numbers of hooks, engine power, and number of sets."
