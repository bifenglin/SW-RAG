    "answer": "The sides of the fuselage need to be sloped (tumbled home) in order to form a conical shape. If the sides were not sloped, the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. The sloping of the sides creates a conical shape, which is necessary for the proper construction of the fuselage."
