    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system is promising, as they have shown to be better models of the biological visual cortex compared to traditional models in the neuroscience community. SNNs have the capability to yield brain-like representations by encoding information with spikes, capturing the dynamics of biological neurons, and extracting spatio-temporal features. Additionally, SNNs have been successful in predicting neural responses in the primate visual cortex, matching the hierarchy of the ventral visual stream, and even controlling neural activity. Despite the immaturity of training algorithms, recent advancements have made it possible to use deep SNNs as visual cortex models, allowing for the exploration of visual processing mechanisms in both macaques and mice."
