    "answer": "The conduction gap is strongly dependent on the strain direction. For example, the conduction gap takes different values for different strain directions, such as $295$ meV for $\\theta = 0^\\circ$, $172$ meV for $\\theta = 30^\\circ$, and $323$ meV for $\\theta = 90^\\circ$. Additionally, the conduction gap is zero at specific angles for both tensile and compressive strains."
