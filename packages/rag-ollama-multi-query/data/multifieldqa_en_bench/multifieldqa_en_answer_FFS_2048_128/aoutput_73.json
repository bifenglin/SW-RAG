    "answer": "Some reasons for the lack of data sharing in archaeobotany include technological limitations, resistance among archaeologists to making their data available, concerns about exposing data to scrutiny, lost opportunities for analysis before others use it, and the perception of the value of reusing previously published datasets as low. Additionally, control over how data tables are presented and the emphasis on creating new data through archaeological research may also contribute to the lack of data sharing."
