    "answer": "The sides of the fuselage need to be sloped (tumbled home) in order to form a conical shape instead of a cylindrical shape. This conical shape, when cut with a plane not perpendicular to its axis, results in an elliptical shape, which is necessary for the structure of the fuselage from the firewall to the tailstock."
