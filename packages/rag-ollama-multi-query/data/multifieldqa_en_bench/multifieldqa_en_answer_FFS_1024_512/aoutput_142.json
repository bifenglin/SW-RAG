    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by speeding it up when the shock wave passes through the bubble. Bubbles with a larger specific-heat ratio move faster on average compared to bubbles with a smaller specific-heat ratio after the shock wave interaction. This is because bubbles with a smaller specific-heat ratio require more energy to compress their size, resulting in smaller translational energy and slower average motion."
