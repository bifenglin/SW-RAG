    "answer": "Some reasons for the lack of data sharing in archaeobotany include technological limitations, resistance among archaeologists to making their data available due to concerns about scrutiny, lost opportunities for analysis before others use it, and loss of 'capital' of data. Control over how data tables are presented and the emphasis on creating new data through archaeological research are also factors that contribute to the preferential publishing of data within journal articles. Additionally, issues such as the conflict between publishing results in excavation monographs versus journal articles for career progression within academia and the time-consuming nature of producing an archaeobotanical dataset may also contribute to the lack of data sharing."
