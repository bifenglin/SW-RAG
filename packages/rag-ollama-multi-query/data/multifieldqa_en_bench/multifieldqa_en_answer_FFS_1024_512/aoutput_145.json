    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE) due to factors such as gear type, number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. When analyzing CPUE per set, there is a positive relationship between catch and these fishing behavior variables. However, when CPUE is standardized by hook number (CPUE per 100 hooks per set), there is a negative relationship between catch and these fishing behavior variables."
