    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by only needing the value of observables, not their derivatives, as training data. It is capable of identifying interpretable latent dynamics which ensure the conservation of important properties reflected in the reduced-order model. The framework uses continuous complex-valued latent space dynamics and only requires one scalar variable per latent dimension to describe the latent space dynamics. This approach does not require enforcing any parametrizations on the Koopman matrix, allowing for the incorporation of sparse and irregularly sampled training data and fast generation of predictions after the training phase. Linear and non-linear autoencoders are used to map the observed high-dimensional time-series to the lower-dimensional latent representation, facilitating the identification of the reduced-order dynamics."
