    "answer": "A media application determines the context of an event by using a content-recognition module to analyze data associated with the event in a media asset. It then distributes itemized tasks to multiple users in order to generate supplemental information about the event. This approach prevents users from being distracted from the media asset and allows the application to collect large amounts of information in a short period of time by leveraging crowd-sourcing. By using multiple viewpoints and sources, the media application enhances the completeness and accuracy of the supplemental information."
