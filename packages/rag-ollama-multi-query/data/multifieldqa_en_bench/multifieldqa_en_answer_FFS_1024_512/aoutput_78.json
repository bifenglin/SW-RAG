    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl, leading to the development of a dc Hall current in bilayer systems. This effect allows for unique control over the on/off, direction, and magnitude of the current by manipulating the phase difference of two driving fields, without affecting the magnitude of the double-frequency component. It also provides a characteristic tunability that makes it a unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers."
