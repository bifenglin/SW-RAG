    "answer": "The relationship between the maximum velocity and the amplitude of the blob or depletion is described as a linear regime in the compressible system for ratios of amplitudes to sizes smaller than a critical value. In this regime, the blob and depletion velocity depends linearly on the initial amplitude and is independent of size."
