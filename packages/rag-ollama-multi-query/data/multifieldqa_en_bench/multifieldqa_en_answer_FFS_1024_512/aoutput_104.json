    "answer": "Smartphones are far more compact and power constrained compared to tablets. The power budget for tablet SoCs is much greater, up to 4W for a passively cooled device and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans. Additionally, the default connectivity for tablets is Wi-Fi rather than a cellular modem, with cellular modems being optional discrete components of the platform."
