    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system lies in their ability to achieve higher similarity scores compared to CNNs with the same depth and almost the same architectures. SNNs outperform their CNN counterparts in neural representation similarity experiments, demonstrating that SNNs could serve as promising candidates to better model and explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system."
