    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability, arising from layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling. This geometric quantity is intrinsic to the band structure and measures the k-space curl of the interlayer Berry connection over the occupied states. This characteristic is a Fermi surface property and is crucial for the emergence of the crossed nonlinear dynamical intrinsic Hall effect in twisted bilayers."
