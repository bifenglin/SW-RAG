    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables differ based on different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE). For unstandardized CPUE (individuals per set), there is a positive relationship with the number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. However, when standardizing CPUE by the number of hooks (individuals per 100 hooks per set), the relationships are reversed. In this case, bottom longlines show a higher standard CPUE compared to surface longlines, with negative relationships between catch per 100 hooks per set and the number of hooks used. This indicates that increasing fishing effort beyond certain levels leads to diminishing returns in catch per unit effort."
