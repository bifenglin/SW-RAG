    "answer": "The relationship between the maximum velocity and the amplitude of the blob or depletion is characterized by a square root scaling. This means that as the amplitude of the blob or depletion increases, the maximum velocity increases as the square root of the amplitude. Additionally, for small amplitudes, there is a linear scaling relationship between the maximum velocity and the amplitude."
