    "answer": "The stability conditions for a solution of $-\\Delta u = f(u)$ are given by the inequality:\n\n\\[ \\int f'(u) \\psi^2 \\le \\int | \\nabla \\psi|^2, \\quad \\forall \\psi \\in C_c^2 \\]\n\nwhere $f'(u)$ is the derivative of the nonlinearity $f(u)$ and $\\psi$ is a function in the set $C_c^2$, which consists of $C^2$ functions defined on $\\mathbb{R}^N$ with compact support."
