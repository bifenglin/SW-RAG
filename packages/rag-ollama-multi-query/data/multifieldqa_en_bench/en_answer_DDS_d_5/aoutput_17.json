    "answer": "The function beta(r) is determined by using the simplified form of the vacuum Einstein equations, specifically the equation that describes the volume of a test ball of freely floating particles. The condition that the second time derivative of the volume with respect to time vanishes at a specific event leads to a differential equation involving beta(r), which can be solved using the method of separation of variables. The solution to this equation provides the function beta(r) for the derivation."
