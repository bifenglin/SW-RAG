    "answer": "The conduction gap depends on the strain direction in the graphene strained junctions. It has been observed that the conduction gap is strongly dependent on the direction of the applied strain. Peaks in the conduction gap occur at specific strain directions, such as $0^\\\\circ$ or $90^\\\\circ$ for tensile strain and $47^\\\\circ$ or $133^\\\\circ$ for compressive strain in the case of transport along the armchair direction. Similarly, for the zigzag direction, the conduction gap peaks at different strain directions. The conduction gap is also influenced by the relationship between the strains and the transport direction, with different behaviors observed for different combinations of strain and direction."
