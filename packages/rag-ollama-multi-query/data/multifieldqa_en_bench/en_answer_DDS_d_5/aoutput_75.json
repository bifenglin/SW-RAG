    "answer": "To estimate the maximum radius of the emitting region for the black body model, we first need to determine the distance to the source. The text suggests that the source is estimated to be around 50 kpc away. Assuming a typical emitting region for the white dwarf atmosphere to be of spherical radius 10^9 cm, and using the distance of 50 kpc, the maximum radius of the emitting region would turn out to be 20 kpc. However, this calculation is approximate, and the actual distance could vary within a range."
