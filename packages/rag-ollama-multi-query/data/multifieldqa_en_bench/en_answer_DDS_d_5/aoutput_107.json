    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by employing a propagator in the latent space to capture the reduced-order dynamics of the system. The latent dynamics are treated independently, enabling the framework to have an interpretable latent dynamics and be suitable for training in the Small Data regime. The continuous complex-valued latent space dynamics and the independent treatment of latent variables allow for a model that can be trained with scarce and irregularly sampled data, directly relying on complex numbers in the latent space. The latent variables and the parameter governing the temporal evolution are complex numbers, similar to eigenvalues, with the real part associated with growth and decay, and the imaginary part representing the periodic component. This approach is different from other methods like Koopman-operator based methods, allowing for the incorporation of sparse and irregularly sampled training data."
