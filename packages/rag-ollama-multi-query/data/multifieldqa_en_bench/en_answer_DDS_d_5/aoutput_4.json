    "answer": "It is important for the sides of the fuselage to be sloped (tumbled home) in order to form a conical section. If the sides were not sloped, the section formed would be cylindrical, and the longerons would lie flat. The conical shape formed when the sides are tumbled home helps in creating the desired fuselage shape."
