    "answer": "The transition probability of the environment affects the learning rate in the static agent by influencing how quickly the weight vectors of the network are updated. Specifically, as the transition probability increases, the evolved learning rate also increases up to a certain point. After reaching a peak, the learning rate begins to decline slowly and eventually reaches zero. This indicates that when the environmental transition is more frequent, faster learning is required to adapt to the changing environment."
