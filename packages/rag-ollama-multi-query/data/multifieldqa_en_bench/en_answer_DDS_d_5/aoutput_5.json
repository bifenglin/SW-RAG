    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity has a significant effect on the Kondo effect. It can lead to the formation of the Kondo singlet, which is a consequence of the two-stage Kondo screening induced by the crossed Andreev reflections (CAR) exchange mechanism. This effect can modify the low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures. Additionally, the presence of superconductivity tends to suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap becomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature. Furthermore, the strength of superconducting pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime. Overall, the proximity of superconductivity can alter the Kondo physics significantly and lead to different screening scenarios."
