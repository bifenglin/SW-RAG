    "answer": "Some reasons for the lack of data sharing in archaeobotany include technological limitations, resistance among archaeologists to make their data available due to concerns about scrutiny and loss of control over data, limitations on word counts imposed by journals, and a focus on creating new data rather than sharing existing datasets. Additionally, issues related to the publication of primary data alongside research articles, such as space constraints and the perception that specialist data is not necessary for publication, may also contribute to the lack of data sharing in archaeobotany."
