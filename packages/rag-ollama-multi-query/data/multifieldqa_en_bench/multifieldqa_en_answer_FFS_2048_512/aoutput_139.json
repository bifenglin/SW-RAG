    "answer": "SNNs have the potential to serve as promising candidates to better model and explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system. They have shown success in fitting complex biological neural representations and exploring the biological visual cortex. Additionally, SNNs have outperformed CNNs in various experiments, indicating their capability to yield brain-like representations and potentially provide insights into the functional specialization of information processing in different species, such as macaques and mice."
