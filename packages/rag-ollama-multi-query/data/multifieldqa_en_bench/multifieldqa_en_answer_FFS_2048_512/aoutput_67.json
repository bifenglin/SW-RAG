    "answer": "The conduction gap is strongly dependent on the strain direction, with peaks occurring at specific angles such as $0^\\circ$ or $90^\\circ$. The conduction gap can be zero at certain angles, such as $47^\\circ$ and $133^\\circ$ for tensile strain, and $43^\\circ$ and $137^\\circ$ for compressive strain."
