    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it leads to the development of a dc Hall current in chiral bilayers when driven by two fields of the same frequency. The phase difference of the two fields can control the on/off, direction, and magnitude of this current. This effect allows for unique tunability and serves as a means for rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers."
