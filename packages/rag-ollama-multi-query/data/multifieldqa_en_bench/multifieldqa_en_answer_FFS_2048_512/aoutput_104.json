    "answer": "Smartphones are far more compact and power constrained compared to tablets. Smartphone SoCs are limited to around 1W, both by batteries and by thermal dissipation. The main purpose of a smartphone is connectivity, so a cellular modem is necessary. On the other hand, tablets have a much greater power budget for SoCs, up to 4W for passively cooled devices and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans. Tablets typically use Wi-Fi for connectivity rather than a cellular modem. Additionally, smartphones often have integrated modems in the SoC, while tablets usually have optional discrete modems."
