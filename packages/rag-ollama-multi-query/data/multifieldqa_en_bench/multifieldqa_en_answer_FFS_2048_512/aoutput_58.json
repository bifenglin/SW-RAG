    "answer": "The dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter following a quench to the critical point is well described by the Gaussian theory for all three lattice gas models studied. In the short-time regime, the anisotropic order parameter varies as $m \\sim t^{1/2}$ and the Binder cumulant of the lowest transverse mode is zero in this regime. The alternative order parameter O distinguishes between the driven lattice gases (IDLG, RDLG) and the equilibrium lattice gas (LG)."
