    "answer": "The experimental techniques used to study the quantum dot structures in this research include scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), constant current mode imaging, and recording of differential conductance spectra (dI/dV) using a lock-in amplifier technique. Additionally, the spatial evolution of the local density of states (LDOS) along a nanotube axis was obtained by creating maps of dI/dV(x,V) built from a series of equidistant dI/dV spectra. The metallic nature of the tip was systematically checked on the gold substrate to prevent any tip artifacts before recording the STM or/and STS data sets."
