    "answer": "The sides of the fuselage need to be sloped (tumbled home) in order to form a conical shape. If the sides were not sloped, the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. The conical shape allows for the longerons to take on an elliptical shape, which is necessary for the proper construction of the fuselage."
