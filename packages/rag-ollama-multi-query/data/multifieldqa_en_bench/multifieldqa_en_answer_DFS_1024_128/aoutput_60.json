    "answer": "The performance of the PLM with decimation drastically outperforms the PLM with $l_2$ regularization and the mean-field technique in reconstructing the network of interaction, especially for lower sample sizes. It is able to clearly infer the network even when $M=N$, indicating its effectiveness in the under-sampling regime. The reconstruction error obtained with the PLM with decimation is consistently smaller than that of the other techniques across all temperatures and sample sizes."
