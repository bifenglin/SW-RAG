    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables differ depending on whether CPUE is unstandardized (individuals per set) or standardized by hook number (individuals per 100 hooks per set). When CPUE is unstandardized, there is a positive association between catch per set and variables such as number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. However, when CPUE is standardized by hook number, the relationships are reversed, with standard CPUE of bottom longlines being significantly higher than that of surface longlines. This pattern is consistent when comparing relationships between CPUE (individuals per set) and standard CPUE for other measures of fishing effort."
