    "answer": "The conduction gap is strongly dependent on the strain direction. Peaks in the conduction gap occur at specific angles of strain, such as $0^\\circ$ or $90^\\circ$, while the gap is zero at other angles of strain. This dependency is observed for both tensile and compressive strains."
