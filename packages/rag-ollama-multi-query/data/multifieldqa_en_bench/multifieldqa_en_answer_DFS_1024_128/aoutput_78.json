    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it allows for a unique rectification functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems. It leads to the development of a dc Hall current that can be controlled by the phase difference of two driving fields, enabling tunability in terms of on/off, direction, and magnitude of the current. This effect is a unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers, showing sizable effects in various materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides and twisted bilayer graphene."
