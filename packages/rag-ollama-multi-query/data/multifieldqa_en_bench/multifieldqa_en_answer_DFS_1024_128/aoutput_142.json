    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by speeding up the motion of bubbles with a larger specific-heat ratio when the shock wave passes through the bubble. This is because bubbles with a smaller specific-heat ratio need more energy to compress their size, resulting in smaller translational energy."
