    "answer": "Smartphones and tablets differ from a technical perspective in terms of power budget for their System on Chips (SoCs), default connectivity, design range, and usage models. Tablets have a greater power budget for their SoCs, up to 4W for passively cooled devices and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans, which allows for a wider range of designs compared to smartphones. Tablets primarily connect via Wi-Fi, while smartphones typically use a cellular modem. Tablets are more commonly sold directly to consumers rather than through carriers, and their usage models are more PC-like with reasonable-sized screens for games and media."
