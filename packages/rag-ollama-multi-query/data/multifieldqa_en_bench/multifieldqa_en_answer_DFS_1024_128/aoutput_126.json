    "answer": "The main focus of the research paper is on studying lattice QCD in the dual formulation, particularly in the strong coupling regime, to gain insights into mechanisms such as confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, restoration at the chiral transition temperature, and the nuclear liquid gas transition. The paper also discusses the Monte Carlo simulations performed in the dual formulation with large quark masses, as well as the comparison of findings with other results."
