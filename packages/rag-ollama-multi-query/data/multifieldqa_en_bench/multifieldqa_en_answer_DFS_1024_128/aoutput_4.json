    "answer": "The sides of the fuselage need to be sloped (tumbled home) in order to form a conical shape, which is necessary for the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped, the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would not lie flat. By sloping the sides, the fuselage takes on an elliptical shape from firewall to tailstock, which is essential for proper construction and structural integrity."
