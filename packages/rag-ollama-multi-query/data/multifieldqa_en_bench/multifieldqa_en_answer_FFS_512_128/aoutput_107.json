    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by only needing the value of the observables, not their derivatives, as training data. It is capable of identifying interpretable latent dynamics, ensuring the conservation of important properties reflected in the reduced-order model. The framework hierarchically decomposes the dynamics into their pertinent scales, promoting the discovery of slow processes that control the system's evolution over long time horizons."
