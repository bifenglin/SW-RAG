    "answer": "Smartphones are far more compact and power constrained compared to tablets. Smartphone SoCs are limited to around 1W, both by batteries and by thermal dissipation. On the other hand, tablets have a much greater power budget for SoCs, up to 4W for a passively cooled device and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans."
