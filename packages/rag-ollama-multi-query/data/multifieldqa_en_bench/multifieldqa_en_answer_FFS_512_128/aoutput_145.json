    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE) as highlighted in the context. The relationships vary spatially and temporally, as well as with several aspects of fishing effort including gear type, hook number, engine power, and number of sets. Additionally, the relationships between CPUE and fishing behavior variables differ for different measures of CPUE such as CPUE per trip, CPUE per set, and CPUE per 100 hooks per set. This emphasizes the importance of using appropriate standardization for meaningful comparisons of CPUE across different gears and vessel types."
