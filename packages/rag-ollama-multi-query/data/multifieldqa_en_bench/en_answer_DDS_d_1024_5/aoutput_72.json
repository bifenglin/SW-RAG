    "answer": "In the numerical experiments, the runtimes and iteration counts of NFPA and FPSA were shown to be significantly lower than GMRES and DSA for all cases. Both NFPA and FPSA outperformed GMRES and DSA by orders of magnitude in terms of runtime and iterations. NFPA and FPSA were comparable in performance, with NFPA even outperforming FPSA in terms of iteration count for some cases. Overall, NFPA and FPSA showed superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to GMRES and DSA in the numerical experiments."
