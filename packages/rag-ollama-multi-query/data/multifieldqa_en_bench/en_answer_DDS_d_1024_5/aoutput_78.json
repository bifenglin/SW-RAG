    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it has a band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability, arising from layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling. This polarizability plays a crucial role in the emergence of an unconventional nonlinear dynamical Hall effect in twisted bilayers, allowing for a unique rectification functionality and serving as a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems."
