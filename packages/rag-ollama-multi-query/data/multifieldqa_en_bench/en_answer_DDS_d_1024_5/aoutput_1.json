    "answer": "No, the ISR (Integrated Stress Response) is not necessary for transgene reactivation, as experiments with Salubrinal and ISRIB showed that the ISR pathway is not sufficient to induce transgene reactivation. Furthermore, knockdown of ATF4, a downstream effector of the ISR, did not interfere with transgene reactivation. Finally, knockout of GCN2, a key kinase in the ISR pathway, did not abolish or reduce transgene reactivation in response to essential amino acid starvation."
