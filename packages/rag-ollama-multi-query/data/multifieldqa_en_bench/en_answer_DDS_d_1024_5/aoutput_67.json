    "answer": "The conduction gap depends on the strain direction in the graphene strained junctions. It has been observed that the conduction gap is strongly dependent on the direction of applied strain, with peaks occurring at specific angles. The conduction gap is larger when the strain is applied in certain directions, such as $0^\\circ$ or $90^\\circ$, while it may be zero at other angles. Additionally, the conduction gap is also influenced by the transport direction, with different directions resulting in different conduction gap values. Overall, the conduction gap in graphene strained junctions is intricately dependent on both the strain direction and the transport direction."
