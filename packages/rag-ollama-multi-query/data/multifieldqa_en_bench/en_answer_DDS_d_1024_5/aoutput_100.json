    "answer": "Using binary variables in the SLAS formulation reduces computational complexity, making the optimization problem more efficient. This allows for faster computation times, making the SLAS module potentially suitable for real-time applications. Additionally, binary variables help in finding feasible solutions quickly, aiding the optimizer in reaching optimal or near-optimal solutions within a reasonable time frame."
