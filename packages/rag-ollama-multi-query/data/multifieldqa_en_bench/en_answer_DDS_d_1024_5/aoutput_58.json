    "answer": "The dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter following a quench to the critical point is well described by the Gaussian theory for all three lattice gas models studied. In the short-time regime, the anisotropic order parameter is proportional to t^(1/2) and the Binder cumulant of the lowest transverse mode is zero in this regime. However, the alternative order parameter O distinguishes between the driven and equilibrium lattice gases. The generic behavior of O is assumed to be proportional to t^alpha*L_parallel^(-1/2), where alpha is a phenomenological exponent."
