    "answer": "The main advantage of a horizontal business model for mobile devices is flexibility. This model allows vendors to offer a wide range of phones based on radically different System on a Chip (SoC) designs.

This approach allows for customization and differentiation in the market, providing a baseline quality and experience for consumers while reducing time to market."
