    "answer": "The receptive field size has an effect on the completion of shapes in the algorithm. The experiment showed that models with bigger receptive field sizes were able to complete shapes with bigger gaps more successfully. The results indicated that as the receptive field size increased, the algorithm was more effective in filling in the gaps in the shapes."
