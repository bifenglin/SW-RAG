    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by employing a propagator in the latent space to capture the dynamics of the system. It uses a continuous complex-valued latent space and treats the latent variables independently. This approach allows for interpretable latent dynamics and is especially suitable for training in the Small Data regime. By solving continuous ODEs in the complex plane for each dimension of the latent variable, the framework identifies the reduced dynamics along different temporal scales. The complex-valued latent variables and parameters governing the temporal evolution describe the system dynamics similar to eigenvalues, where the real part represents growth and decay, and the imaginary part represents periodic components. This approach allows for the incorporation of scarce and irregularly sampled training data and directly relies on complex numbers in the latent space to capture the reduced-order dynamics."
