    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE). For example, the unstandardized CPUE (individuals per set) was significantly higher for surface longlines than for bottom longlines. However, when standardizing CPUE for the number of hooks, the relationship was reversed, with bottom longlines exhibiting a higher standardized CPUE. Additionally, there was a positive relationship between unstandardized CPUE and factors like the number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets, but a negative relationship between CPUE and these fishing behavior variables when CPUE was standardized by hook number. This indicates that there are diminishing returns above relatively low levels of fishing effort, highlighting the importance of using appropriate standardization methods for meaningful comparisons of CPUE across different gears and vessel types."
