    "answer": "The proposed approach in this research paper is to provide a probabilistic interpretation of the least-mean-square (LMS) filter by approximating the posterior distribution with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. This approximation leads to an adaptable step-size LMS algorithm that performs well in both stationary and tracking scenarios."
