    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it plays a key role in the novel band geometric origin of the nonlinear Hall effect in time-reversal symmetric twisted bilayers. It arises from the interlayer hybridization of electronic states under the chiral crystal symmetry characteristic of twisted bilayers and allows for the development of a dc Hall current that can be controlled by the phase difference of two driving fields. This effect provides a unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers."
