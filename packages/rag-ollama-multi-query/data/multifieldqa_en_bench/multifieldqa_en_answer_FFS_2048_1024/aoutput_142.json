    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by speeding up the average motion of the bubbles when the shock wave passes through the bubble. This is because bubbles with a larger specific-heat ratio require less energy to compress their size, resulting in higher translational energy and faster average motion."
