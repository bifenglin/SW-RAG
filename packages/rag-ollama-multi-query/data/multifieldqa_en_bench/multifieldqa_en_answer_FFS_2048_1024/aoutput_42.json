    "answer": "The relationship between the maximum velocity and the amplitude of the blob or depletion is that for relative amplitudes below a certain threshold, the velocities coincide with each other. However, for amplitudes larger than that threshold, the velocities follow a square root scaling. Additionally, for plasma depletions beyond a certain percentage, the velocities in both systems reach a constant value predicted by the square root scaling."
