    "answer": "The performance of the PLM with decimation is better than the other methods. The reconstruction error obtained with the PLM+decimation is always smaller than that obtained with other techniques. The error obtained with the PLM with decimation is several times smaller than the error estimated by the other methods. Additionally, the PLM with decimation leads to cleaner results compared to other techniques."
