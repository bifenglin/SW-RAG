    "answer": "The dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter following a quench to the critical point is well described by the Gaussian theory for all three lattice gas models studied. In the short-time regime, the anisotropic order parameter varies as $O \\sim t^{\\alpha} L_{\\parallel}^{-1/2}$, where $\\alpha$ is a phenomenological exponent to be determined."
