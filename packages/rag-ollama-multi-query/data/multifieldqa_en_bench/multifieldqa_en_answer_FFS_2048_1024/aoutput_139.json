    "answer": "SNNs have the potential to better model and explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system, outperforming traditional models in the neuroscience community. They can capture the dynamics of biological neurons, extract spatio-temporal features, and yield brain-like representations, making them promising candidates for studying the visual system."
