    "answer": "Smartphones are more compact and power constrained compared to tablets. Smartphone SoCs are limited to around 1W, both by batteries and thermal dissipation. Smartphones require a cellular modem for connectivity, with the modem often integrated into the SoC itself. In contrast, tablets have a much greater power budget for SoCs, up to 4W for a passively cooled device and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans. Tablets typically do not have cellular modems as the default connectivity is Wi-Fi."
