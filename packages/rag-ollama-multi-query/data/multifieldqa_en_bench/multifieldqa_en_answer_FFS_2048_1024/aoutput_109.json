    "answer": "The electron correlation parameter, $\\Gamma_e$, is defined as the ratio of the average unscreened electron-electron potential energy to the electron kinetic energy, as given by the equation $\\Gamma_e = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 a_{ws}}\\frac{1}{k_B T_e}$, where $a_{ws}$ is the Wigner-Seitz radius."
