    "answer": "The stability condition for a solution of $-\\Delta u = f(u)$ is that the second variation at $u$ of the energy associated with the equation is non-negative. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\int f'(u) \\psi^2 \\le \\int | \\nabla \\psi|^2, \\quad \\forall \\psi \\in C_c^2, \\]\nwhere $C_c^2$ is the set of $C^2$ functions defined on $\\mathbb{R}^N$ with compact support."
