    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by employing a propagator in the latent space to capture the reduced-order dynamics of the system. This allows for the identification of interpretable latent dynamics, ensuring the conservation of important properties that are reflected in the reduced-order model. The method uses a time-continuous complex-valued latent space dynamics and only requires one scalar variable per latent dimension to describe the latent space dynamics. By using a complex-valued latent space, the framework can also incorporate harmonic effects and reduce the number of latent variables needed. Linear and non-linear autoencoders are used to map the observed, high-dimensional time series to the lower-dimensional, latent representation, and the autoencoder as well as the latent dynamics are identified simultaneously by optimizing a combined loss function."
