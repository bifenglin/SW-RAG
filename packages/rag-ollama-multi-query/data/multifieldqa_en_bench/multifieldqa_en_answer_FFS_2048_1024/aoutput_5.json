    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity can either enhance or suppress the Kondo effect, depending on the energy scales involved. If the superconducting energy gap becomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature, it tends to suppress the Kondo effect. However, if there is inter-dot pairing present, it can enhance the Kondo effect."
