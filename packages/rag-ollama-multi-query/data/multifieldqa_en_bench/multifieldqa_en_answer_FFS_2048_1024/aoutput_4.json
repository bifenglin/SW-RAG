    "answer": "It is important for the sides of the fuselage to be sloped (tumbled home) because when the sides are not sloped, the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. However, since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical, which allows for the fuselage to take on an elliptical shape from firewall to tailstock."
