    "answer": "The function beta(r) is determined by exploiting the symmetries of the solutions and the properties of infalling observers, leading to a simple form of the metric with only one unknown function of one variable, beta(r). Additional information from the Einstein equations is used to determine beta(r) in the derivation."
