    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by speeding up the motion when the shock wave passes through the bubble (t > 0.03). Bubbles with a larger specific-heat ratio move faster because they require less energy to compress their size compared to bubbles with a smaller specific-heat ratio."
