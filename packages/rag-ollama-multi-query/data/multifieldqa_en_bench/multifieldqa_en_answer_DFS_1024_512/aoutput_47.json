    "answer": "The problem encountered when building the fuselage sides is that the top longeron ends up with a curve, forming a dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. This occurs when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section, and the longerons bow up from the building surface, creating an unacceptable curve. The issue arises due to the three-dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built and the fact that the sides are sloped outward, causing the distances given by measuring the profile drawing to be \"foreshortened\" and not suitable for building a fuselage with a flat top longeron."
