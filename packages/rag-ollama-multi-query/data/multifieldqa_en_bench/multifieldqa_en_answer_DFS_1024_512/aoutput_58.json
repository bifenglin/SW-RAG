    "answer": "The dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter following a quench to the critical point is well described by the Gaussian theory, where in the short-time regime, the order parameter $m$ scales as $t^{1/2}$ and the Binder cumulant $g$ of the lowest transverse mode is zero. The alternative order parameter $O$ distinguishes between the driven lattice gases (IDLG, RDLG) and the equilibrium lattice gas (LG). The behavior of $O$ can be assumed to scale as $O \\sim t^{\\alpha} L_{\\parallel}^{-1/2}$, where $\\alpha$ is a phenomenological exponent."
