    "answer": "Dendritic spines contain actin and have been shown to be highly dynamic. They form the post-synaptic compartment of synapses and are rich in actin. They also contain a complex network of proteins that link extracellular signals with the actin cytoskeleton, allowing for control of dendritic spine morphology and number. Abnormal dendritic spine morphology or numbers have been associated with various disease states, suggesting that proteins within dendritic spines may contribute to aberrant spine plasticity underlying the pathophysiology of these disorders."
