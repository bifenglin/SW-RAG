    "answer": "Some reasons for the lack of data sharing in archaeobotany include technological limitations, resistance among archaeologists to making their data available due to concerns about scrutiny, lost opportunities for analysis before others use the data, and the perception of loss of 'capital' of data. Additionally, control over how data tables are presented, the emphasis on creating new data through archaeological research, and the low perceived value of reusing previously published archaeobotanical datasets may also contribute to the lack of data sharing."
