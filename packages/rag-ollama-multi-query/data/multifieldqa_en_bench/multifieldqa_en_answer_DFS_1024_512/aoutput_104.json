    "answer": "Smartphones are more compact and power-constrained, with smartphone SoCs limited to around 1W. They require a cellular modem for connectivity, which is integrated into the SoC for cost-sensitive models. On the other hand, tablets have a greater power budget for SoCs, up to 4W for passively cooled devices and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans. They default to Wi-Fi connectivity rather than a cellular modem, with cellular modems being optional discrete components."
