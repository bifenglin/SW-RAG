    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl, which results in unique rectification and transport probe capabilities for chiral bilayers. It allows for the development of a dc Hall current that can be controlled in terms of on/off, direction, and magnitude by the phase difference of two driving fields of the same frequency. This effect is particularly pronounced in twisted bilayers like transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene."
