    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables differ depending on whether the CPUE is unstandardized (individuals per set) or standardized (individuals per 100 hooks per set). When looking at unstandardized CPUE, there is a positive relationship between catch per set and variables such as number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. However, when CPUE is standardized by hook number, the relationship is reversed, with standardized CPUE of bottom longlines being significantly higher than that of surface longlines. This pattern is consistent when comparing relationships between CPUE (individuals per set) and standardized CPUE for other measures of fishing effort."
