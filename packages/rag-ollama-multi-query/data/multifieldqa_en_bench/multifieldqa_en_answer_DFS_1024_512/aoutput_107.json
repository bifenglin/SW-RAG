    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by using autoencoders to map high-dimensional time series data to a lower-dimensional latent representation. This latent representation is interpretable and allows for the identification of important properties that are reflected in the reduced-order model. The framework uses a continuous complex-valued latent space dynamics and only requires one scalar variable per latent dimension to describe the dynamics. By unifying the tasks of dimensionality reduction and discovery of reduced dynamics, the framework ensures that important properties are conserved in the reduced-order model. Additionally, the framework allows for the incorporation of sparse and irregularly sampled training data and can incorporate harmonic effects while reducing the number of latent variables needed."
