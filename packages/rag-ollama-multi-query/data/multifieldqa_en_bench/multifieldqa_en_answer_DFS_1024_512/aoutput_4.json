    "answer": "It is important for the sides of the fuselage to be sloped (tumbled home) because when the sides are sloped, the section formed is conical. This conical shape allows for the fuselage to be built with a flat top longeron, preventing the formation of a dissatisfying \"banana\" shape in the fuselage."
