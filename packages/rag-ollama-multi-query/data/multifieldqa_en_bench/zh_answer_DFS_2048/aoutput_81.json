    "answer": "A media application determines the context of an event by using content-recognition modules and algorithms to process data associated with the event. This may include cross-referencing the data in a database indicating the different contexts the event may have. Additionally, the media application may use multiple types of optical character recognition, fuzzy logic, and speech recognition techniques to analyze the event and determine its context."
