    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by using a propagator in the latent space to model the system's dynamics. The latent space dynamics are represented by a continuous complex-valued ODE in the complex plane, allowing for the interpretation of the reduced dynamics. This approach enables the framework to identify the temporal evolution of the system using complex numbers in the latent space, similar to the role of an eigenvalue in describing system dynamics."
