    "answer": "The conduction gap is strongly dependent on the strain direction. For example, in the case of a strain of 6%, the conduction gap peaks occur at certain angles such as θ = 0 or 90°, while the gap is zero at other angles such as θ ≈ 47° and 133° for tensile strain and θ ≈ 43° and 137° for compressive strain. Additionally, the conduction gap is larger when there is a larger shift of Dirac points in the κy-axis. The effects of strain in one direction are qualitatively similar to the effects of strain in the opposite direction rotated by 90°."
