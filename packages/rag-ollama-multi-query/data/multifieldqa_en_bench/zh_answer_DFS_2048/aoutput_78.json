    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it allows for unique rectification functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems. It also contributes to the generation of a novel intrinsic Hall response with controllable on/off, direction, and magnitude of the rectified dc Hall current."
