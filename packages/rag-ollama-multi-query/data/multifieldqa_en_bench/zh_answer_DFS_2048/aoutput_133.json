    "answer": "The advantage of decorrelating the data before running the PLS algorithm is that it improves the performance of the algorithm. By decorrelating the data, the PLS algorithm can provide a small-dimensional and robust representation of proteins, enabling it to identify the atomic dynamics relevant for the response variable Y more effectively."
