    "answer": "It is important for the sides of the fuselage to be sloped (tumbled home) because when the sides are sloped, the section formed is conical. This conical shape, when cut with a plane not perpendicular to its axis, forms an elliptical shape, which is necessary for the fuselage to take on an elliptical shape from firewall to tailstock."
