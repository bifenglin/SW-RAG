    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity can suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap becomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature. Additionally, the strength of superconducting pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime, either enhancing or suppressing the Kondo effect depending on the specific setup."
