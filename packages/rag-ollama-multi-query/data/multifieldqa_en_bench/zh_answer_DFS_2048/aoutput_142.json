    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by speeding up the motion of bubbles with a larger specific-heat ratio when the shock wave passes through the bubble (t > 0.03). This is because bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratios need more energy to compress their size, resulting in smaller translational energy."
