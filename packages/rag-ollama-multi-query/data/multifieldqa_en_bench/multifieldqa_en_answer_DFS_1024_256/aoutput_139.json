    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system lies in their ability to serve as a shortcut to explore the biological visual cortex. Studies on various aspects of SNNs, such as model architectures, learning algorithms, processing mechanisms, and neural coding methods, show promise in better explaining the sophisticated, complex, and diverse vision systems in the future."
