    "answer": "Smartphones are more compact and power-constrained, with smartphone SoCs limited to around 1W due to battery and thermal limitations. Smartphones require a cellular modem for connectivity, with the modem integrated into the SoC for cost-sensitive models. Smartphone vendors like HTC must pass government certification and carrier approval. On the other hand, tablets have a higher power budget for SoCs, ranging up to 4W for passively cooled devices and 7-8W for systems with fans. Tablets default to Wi-Fi connectivity rather than cellular modems, with cellular modems being optional components. Tablets are more PC-like in terms of usage models, with larger screens that make games and media more attractive. Tablets are also sold more commonly directly to consumers rather than through carriers."
