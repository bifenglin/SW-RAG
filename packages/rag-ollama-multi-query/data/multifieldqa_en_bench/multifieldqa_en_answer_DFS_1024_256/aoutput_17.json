    "answer": "The function $\\\\beta(r)$ is determined by using the vacuum Einstein equations, specifically by applying them to a test ball in free fall alongside a family of observers. The integration of the equations allows for the determination of $\\\\beta(r)$, with the final form being obtained by fixing integration constants based on the requirements for large values of $r to correspond to results from Newtonian gravity."
