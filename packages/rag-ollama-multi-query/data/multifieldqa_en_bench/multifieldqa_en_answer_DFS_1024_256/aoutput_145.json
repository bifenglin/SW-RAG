    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE) because when controlling for hook number using standardised CPUE (individuals per 100 hooks per set), the relationships were reversed. This means that the standardised CPUE of bottom longlines was significantly higher than that of surface longlines."
