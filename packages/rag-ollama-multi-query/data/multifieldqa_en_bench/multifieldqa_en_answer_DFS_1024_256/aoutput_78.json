    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it allows for the development of a dc Hall current in a bilayer system when two driving fields of the same frequency are present. The phase difference of the two fields can control the on/off state, direction, and magnitude of this Hall current, providing a unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers. The interlayer Berry connection polarizability has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl, contributing to the tunability and functionality of the effect."
