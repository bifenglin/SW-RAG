    "answer": "The vacuum processing system is configured with a plurality of vacuum processing chambers set in parallel, including a vacuum processing chamber formed by the UHF-ECR reactor and another vacuum processing chamber. These chambers are symmetrically arranged with respect to the axis passing through the center of the vacuum transfer chamber and the locking device. The positions of the two vacuum processing chambers are at an acute angle with respect to the vacuum transfer chamber, and all the vacuum processing chambers of the multiple vacuum processing apparatus are arranged in a straight line."
