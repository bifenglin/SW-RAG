    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by speeding up the motion when the shock wave passes through the bubble, especially with a larger specific-heat ratio. This is because bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratios need more energy to compress their size, resulting in slower translational energy."
