    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it allows for the development of a dc Hall current that can be controlled by the phase difference of two driving fields of the same frequency. This effect can be used for rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers, showing sizable effects in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides and twisted bilayer graphene."
