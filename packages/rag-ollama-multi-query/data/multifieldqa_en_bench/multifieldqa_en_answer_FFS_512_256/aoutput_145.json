    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables differ for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE). When looking at unstandardized CPUE (individuals per set), there is a positive relationship with the number of hooks, number of sets, and engine power. However, when CPUE is standardized by hook number (individuals per 100 hooks per set), there is a negative relationship between CPUE and these fishing behavior variables."
