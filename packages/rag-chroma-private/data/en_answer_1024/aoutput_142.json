    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble differently depending on the stage. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. However, after the shock passes through the bubble, a larger specific-heat ratio speeds up the average motion of the bubbles. This is because bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratios need more energy to compress their size, resulting in smaller translational energy."
