    "answer": "A media application determines the context of an event by using multiple types of content-recognition modules and algorithms to process data associated with the event. This may include cross-referencing the data in a database indicating the different contexts the event may have. Additionally, the media application may generate supplemental information about an event by transmitting a request for additional information regarding the context of the event to multiple users and generating the supplemental information based on the messages received from the users."
