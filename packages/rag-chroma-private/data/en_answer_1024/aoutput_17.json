    "answer": "The function beta(r) is determined in the derivation by considering the coordinate speed of infalling observers and expressing both their proper time rate and their coordinate speed in terms of r and t. By combining these pieces of information and rescaling the resulting function with the speed of light, giving it an overall minus sign to make it positive for infalling particles, the function beta(r) is defined."
