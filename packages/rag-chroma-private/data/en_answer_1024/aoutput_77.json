    "answer": "The receptive field size affects the completion of shapes by enabling models with bigger receptive field sizes to reconstruct shapes with bigger gaps more effectively. The results of the experiment show that the bigger the receptive field size, the more complete shapes can be reconstructed using DSP. Additionally, the effect of the receptive filter size on the algorithm's capability to fill in bigger gap sizes is shown to be more successful with bigger filter sizes."
