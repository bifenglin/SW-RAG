    "answer": "The relationship between the maximum velocity and the amplitude of the blob or depletion is that for relative amplitudes below $|\\triangle n|/n_0 \\simeq 0.5$ (right of unity in the plot), the velocities coincide with the corresponding blob velocities. For amplitudes larger than $|\\triangle n|/n_0 \\simeq 0.5$, the velocities follow a square root scaling."
