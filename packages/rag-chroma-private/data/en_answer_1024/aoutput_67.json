    "answer": "The conduction gap is strongly dependent on the strain direction, with the preferred transport directions to achieve a large conduction gap being close to the armchair direction. In particular, the conduction gap is generally smaller for other strain directions, such as $\\\\phi = 30^\\\\circ$ compared to $\\\\phi = 0$."
