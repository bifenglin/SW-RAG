    "answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables are different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE). When controlling for hook number using standardised CPUE (individuals per 100 hooks per set), the relationships were reversed, with standardised CPUE of bottom longlines significantly higher than that of surface longlines. There was a positive relationship between unstandardised CPUE (individuals per set) and number of hooks, number of sets, and engine power, but a negative relationship between CPUE and these fishing behavior variables when CPUE was standardised by hook number (individuals per 100 hooks per set)."
