    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system is promising as they could serve as better candidates to explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system. Additionally, SNNs are considered more biologically plausible neural networks and may provide a shortcut to explore the biological visual cortex."
