    "answer": "Smartphones and tablets differ from a technical perspective in terms of power budget for System on Chips (SoCs). Tablets have a much greater power budget for SoCs, up to 4W for passively cooled devices and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans, compared to smartphones. Additionally, the default connectivity for tablets is Wi-Fi rather than a cellular modem, with the majority of tablets not having cellular modems."
