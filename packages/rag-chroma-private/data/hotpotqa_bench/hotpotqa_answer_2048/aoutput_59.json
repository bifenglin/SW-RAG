    "answer": "Elephants are connected to Gajabrishta through the construction of temples by the later Cholas of the Chola empire in the Indian subcontinent. The vimanas of these temples were constructed in the style of elephants, specifically with the back or hip portion of a sitting elephant known as \"Brishta.\" The sanctum sanctorum of these temples, especially Shiva temples, followed this style of vimana."
