    "context": "Passage 1:\nMirtemir\nMirtemir Tursunov (Uzbek: Миртемир Турсунов) (May 30, 1910 - January 25, 1978) most commonly known simply as Mirtemir, was an Uzbek poet and literary translator. In addition to writing his own poetry, Mirtemir translated the works of many famous foreign poets, such as Abai Qunanbaiuli, Aleksandr Pushkin, Heinrich Heine, Magtymguly Pyragy, Maxim Gorky, Mikhail Lermontov, Nâzım Hikmet, Nikolay Nekrasov, Pablo Neruda, Samad Vurgun, and Shota Rustaveli into the Uzbek language.Mirtemir became a National Poet of the Uzbek SSR in 1971. He received many other awards for his works, including the State Berdaq Prize (1977) and the State Hamza Prize (1979). In 2002, Mirtemir was posthumously awarded the National Order of Merit (Uzbek: Buyuk xizmatlari uchun), one of independent Uzbekistan's most prestigious awards.\n\nLife and work\nMirtemir Umarbekovich Tursunov was born on May 30, 1910, in the village of Ikan, Turkistan. In 1932, Mirtemir graduated from the Pedagogical University of Samarkand with a degree in literature.\nMirtemir's first collection of poems, Shuʼlalar qoʻynida (Under the Lights) was published in 1928. His other collections of poetry include Zafar (Victory) (1929), Qaynashlarim (My Rages), Bong (The Clamor) (1932), and Poytaxt (The Capital) (1936).\nMirtemir translated the works of many famous foreign poets, such as Abai Qunanbaiuli, Aleksandr Pushkin, Berdaq, Heinrich Heine, Magtymguly Pyragy, Maxim Gorky, Mikhail Lermontov, Nâzım Hikmet, Nikolay Nekrasov, Pablo Neruda, Samad Vurgun, and Shota Rustaveli into Uzbek. In particular, he translated Who is Happy in Russia? of Nikolay Nekrasov and The Man in the Panther's Skin of Shota Rustaveli into Uzbek. He also translated the Kyrgyz epic poem Manas.\nAn example of his work, written originally in Cyrillic alphabet:\nThis is my mother tongue, the language of my dear mother. It permeated my soul and ear since I was in the cradle. This is the language of my people, my homeland, and my folks. In life time it is as old as mother earth.\nMirtemir died in Tashkent on 25 January 1978, at the age of 67.\nPassage 2:\nLavinia exilicauda\nThe hitch (Lavinia exilicauda) is a cyprinid fish endemic to central California, and was once very common. The common name may derive from a Pomoan word for this species. It is the only species in the monospecific genus Lavinia.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe hitch was first formally described in 1854 by Spencer Fullerton Baird and Charles Frédéric Girard with its type locality given as the Sacramento River in California. While the hitch is closely related to the California roach (Hesperoleucus symmetricus), and the two species can hybridize, leading some authorities to place H. symmetricus in Lavinia, genomic data appear to support the fishes' separate lineages. The Lavinia genus has been placed in the subfamily Leuciscinae of the family Cyprinidae in the 5th edition of Fishes of the World. Other authorities classify the Leuciscidae as a family and place the genus Lavinia in the subfamily Laviniinae of that family.Three distinct population segments (DPS) or subspecies of the hitch are recognized:\n\nClear Lake hitch (chi in Pomoan language)\nMonterey hitch (Salinas hitch, Pajaro hitch)\nSacramento hitch (Central Valley hitch)These common names or DPS correspond to the subspecies Lavinia exilicauda chi Hopkirk, 1974, Lavinia exilicauda harengus Girard, 1856: 183–184  and Lavinia exilicauda exilicauda Baird and Girard in Girard, 1854,: 137  respectively.\n\nDescription\nThe hitch shape is deep and laterally compressed, with a small head, and a terminal mouth pointing upwards. They are generally silver all over; younger fish have a black spot at the base of the tail, losing it as they age, and becoming generally darker as well. The anal fin is noticeably longer than for other California minnows, with 11-14 rays, while the dorsal fin has 10-13 rays, and is placed further back, the base being positioned between pelvic and anal fins. The tail fin is large and deeply forked. They can get large for minnows, with lengths of up to 36 cm.  All of these features make them look much like the golden shiner. The hitch is closely related to the California roach (Hesperoleucus symmetricus complex), and these taxa can hybridize with each other.Hitch are omnivores of the open water, eating a combination of filamentous algae, insects, and zooplankton. They can be found in lakes, sloughs, and slow-moving sections of rivers and streams. With the highest temperature tolerance among the native fish of the Central Valley, they can be found in both warm and cool water; they also have considerable salt tolerance, for instance occurring in Suisun Marsh (7-8 ppt salinity), and Salinas River lagoon (9 ppt).\n\nDistribution\nTheir range includes the Sacramento River-San Joaquin River System of the Central Valley, the Russian River, Clear Lake, Pajaro River, and Salinas River. Although once abundant, but no longer commercially fished in Clear Lake, populations have been declining. The most likely cause appears to be loss of springtime spawning water flows due to water diversion and damming.\n\nConservation\nThe Clear Lake hitch was listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act in 2014.\n\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nUEA Creative Writing Course\nThe University of East Anglia's Creative Writing Course was founded by Sir Malcolm Bradbury and Sir Angus Wilson in 1970. The M.A. is widely regarded as the most prestigious and successful in the country  and competition for places is notoriously tough.The course is split into four strands: Prose, Creative Non-Fiction, Poetry and Scriptwriting (which is Skillset accredited). All four result in an M.A. qualification upon successful completion of the course. The Course Directors are currently Andrew Cowan, Kathryn Hughes, Lavinia Greenlaw and Val Taylor respectively. Course tutors include Amit Chaudhuri, Trezza Azzopardi, Giles Foden, Tobias Jones, James Lasdun, Jean McNeil, Margaret Atwood and George Szirtes.\nWriters such as Angela Carter, Rose Tremain, Andrew Motion, W.

The medal is awarded every two years to world poets and writers.\n\nNâzım Hikmet\nA famous Turkish poet, playwright, novelist, memoirist, painter, public figure, International Peace Prize laureate and the founder of the Turkish revolutionary poetry, Nâzım Hikmet Ran was born on 15 January 1902 in Salonica. He was the son of an Ottoman government official and grew up in Anatolia. After briefly attending the Turkish naval academy, he studied economics and political science at the University of Moscow. Nazim Hikmet was repeatedly arrested for his political beliefs and spent much of his adult life in prison or in exile. His poetry has been translated into more than fifty languages, plays have been staged in several countries gaining huge popularity.\nNazim Hikmet's first book of poetry was “Song of the Sun-drinkers”, published in Baku in 1928. Many of his works have been translated into English, including \"Human Landscapes from My Country: An Epic Novel in Verse\" (2009), \"Things I Didn’t Know I Loved\" (1975), \"The Day Before Tomorrow\" (1972), \"The Moscow Symphony\" (1970), and \"Selected Poems\" (1967). In 1936 he published Seyh Bedreddin destani (“The Epic of Shaykh Bedreddin”) and Memleketimden insan manzaralari (“Portraits of People from My Land”). In 1950 he won the Nobel Peace Prize.\nHikmet died of a heart attack in Moscow in 1963. As the first modern Turkish poet, he is recognized around the world as one of the great international poets of the twentieth century.\n\nNazim Hikmet Culture and Arts Foundation\nAfter the death of Nazim Hikmet his close friends under the leadership of his sister Samia Yaltirim and Prof.Dr.Aydin Aybay decided to set up a foundation in his name. Due to his friends efforts, the “Nazim Hikmet Culture and Arts Foundation” was established by Samia Yaltirim in 1991.\nThe purpose of “Nazim Hikmet Culture and Arts Foundation” was to establish a center which will collect and introduce any articles, books, pictures, paintings, movies, music, sculpture, memorials and research about Nazim Hikmet to future generations.\nIn order to always cherish the memory of Nazim Hikmet, to ensure the dissemination of his works and to assess contribution of contemporary poets the foundation established \"International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award\".\n\nAward holders\nThe first winner of the \"International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award\" ceremony which held on January 14, 1995, considering the value of artistic and intellectual properties of works was Syrian poet Adonis, who is currently living in France.\nThe second winner of \"International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award\" was Aime Cesaire from Martinique in 1997. He won this award for explaining in detail the longing for freedom and equality of all oppressed people in the twentieth century.\nThe third winner of \"International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award\" was the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish in 2003. Then a next winner was the Danish poet Erik Stinus in 2009. Erik Stinus moves his readers away from the ironic character of Danish poetry. On the other hand, Stinus is a great poet of Western poetry who focuses on life and who bears witness to his era.\nI\nn recent years there have been some problems for nominating the \"International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award\" every two years, such as financial deficiencies and the attracting of voters from the international organization.\nFinally, after a long time off, on February 7, 2014, due to the positive contribution towards Turkish World and the tenderness of his poetry, Zalimkhan Yagub was awarded with \"International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award\" by The International Academy of Sciences of Turkish World Investigation.  Zalimkhan Yaghub was the first poet from Azerbaijan who was honoured with that medal.\n\nExternal links\nVilayat Jafar, “Friendship in the strange land”, Baku, 2005\nA.Ismayilov, “Nazim Hikmet's life and literary chronicle”\nhttp://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai131_folder/131_articles/131_poet_hikmet_nazim.html\nhttp://www.nazimhikmet.org.tr/index2.asp\nhttp://www.azadliq.org/content/article/25318044.html\nPassage 5:\nLavinia Greenlaw\nLavinia Elaine Greenlaw (born 30 July 1962) is an English poet, novelist and non-fiction writer. She won the Prix du Premier Roman with her first novel and her poetry has been shortlisted for awards that include the T. S. Eliot Prize, Forward Prize and Whitbread Poetry Prize. She was shortlisted for the 2014 Costa Poetry Award for A Double Sorrow: A Version of Troilus and Criseyde. Greenlaw currently holds the post of Professor of Creative Writing (Poetry) at Royal Holloway, University of London.\n\nBiography\nLavinia Greenlaw was born in London into a medical and scientific family, and has a sister and two brothers. When she was aged 11, the family moved from London to an Essex village, where they lived for seven years. This period Greenlaw has described as \"an interim time\", with \"memories of time being arrested, nothing much happening.\"\nGreenlaw went on to read modern arts at Kingston Polytechnic. She then studied at the London College of Printing and gained an MA in art history from the Courtauld Institute. She was employed as an editor at Imperial College of Science and Technology (1985–1986) and with the publishers Allison & Busby (1986–1987),  and subsequently with Earthscan (1988–90). She also worked as an arts administrator for Southbank Centre (1990–1991) and the London Arts Board (1991–1994).\nGreenlaw's career as a freelance artist, critic and broadcaster began in 1994. She became the first artist-in-residence at the Science Museum (1994–1995), and has since held residences at the Royal Festival Hall, at a London solicitors' firm (1997–1998), and at the Royal Society of Medicine (2004). In 2013 she won an Engagement Fellowship from the Wellcome Trust. Her sound work Audio Obscura was commissioned in 2011 by Artangel and Manchester International Festival, and heard at Manchester Piccadilly station in July 2011 and London St Pancras station in September and October 2011. It won the 2011 Ted Hughes Award for New Work in Poetry, the judges calling it \"groundbreaking\".Greenlaw taught at Goldsmiths College, University of London. She served as professor of creative writing at the University of East Anglia from 2007 to 2013, and as a visiting professor at King's College London (2015–2016) and Freie Universität Berlin (2017). She currently holds the post of Professor of Creative Writing (Poetry) at Royal Holloway, University of London.After judging the 2010 Manchester Poetry Prize, Greenlaw chaired in 2014 the judging panel for the inaugural Folio Prize. She is a Council member of the Royal Society of Literature and a former Chair of the Poetry Society.Greenlaw has lived in London for most of her life.\n\nWriting\nPrimarily a poet, Greenlaw has also written novels, short stories, plays and non-fiction. She has made radio documentaries. Her work for music includes the libretto for the opera Peter Pan composed by Richard Ayres (Staatsoper Stuttgart/Komische Oper Berlin/Welsh National Opera and Royal Opera House, 2015). Publications for which she has written include the London Review of Books, The Guardian and The New Yorker, and in 2019 she was a contributor to A New Divan: A Lyrical Dialogue Between East and West (Gingko Library).Her work draws on her interest in science and scientific enquiry and covers themes of displacement, loss and belonging. Critics have seen her poetry as remarkable for its precision; her best contain a complexity and elusiveness that lead them to \"appreciate with each re-reading\".Her biography notes: \"She has written and adapted several dramas for radio, including Virginia Woolf's Night and Day, Hermann Hesse's The Glass Bead Game, and a series on malaria called Five Fever Tales. She has made documentaries about Emily Dickinson and Elizabeth Bishop and several programmes about light, including trips to the Arctic midsummer and midwinter, the Baltic, the darkest place in England, light in London, and the solstices and equinoxes.\"Greenlaw is also a memoirist. Kirkus Reviews summed up her 2007 coming-of-age book, The Importance of Music to Girls, by saying: \"The taut, lyric thrum of Greenlaw's prose reflects her poet's skill....Well-written, bewitching and subtly dazzling.\" Some Answers Without Questions (2021), part memoir, part manifesto, was described by Hephzibah Anderson in The Observer as \"a delight: approachable, rigorous and omnivorous in its frame of reference\".\n\nAwards and recognition\nLavinia Greenlaw received an Eric Gregory Award in 1990, an Arts Council Writers' Award in 1995, a Cholmondeley Award, and a Society of Authors Travelling Scholarship. In 1994 she was chosen as one of 20 New Generation Poets, by a jury composed of Melvyn Bragg, Margaret Busby, Vicki Feather, Michael Longley, John Osborne and James Wood. In 1997, Greenlaw won the Forward Prize for Best Single Poem for \"A World Where News Travelled Slowly\", the title poem from her second main collection.For her 2001 first novel, Mary George of Allnorthover, Greenlaw won the French Prix du Premier Roman.

He was acclaimed for the \"lyrical flow of his statements\". Described as a \"romantic communist\" and a \"romantic revolutionary\", he was repeatedly arrested for his political beliefs and spent much of his adult life in prison or in exile. His poetry has been translated into more than 50 languages.\n\nFamily\nAccording to Nâzım Hikmet, he was of paternal Turkish and maternal German, Polish and Georgian descent. His mother came from a distinguished cosmopolitan family with predominantly-Circassian (Adyghe) roots, along with high social position and relations to the Polish nobility. From his father's side, he had Turkish heritage. His father, Hikmet Bey, was the son of Çerkes Nâzım Pasha, another Circassian, after whom Nâzım Hikmet was named.\nNazım’s maternal grandfather, Hasan Enver Pasha, was the son of the Polish-born Mustafa Celalettin Pasha and Saffet Hanım, the daughter, Omar Pasha, a Serbian, and Adviye Hanım, a Circassian who was the daughter of Çerkes Hafız Pasha.\nMustafa Celalettin Pasha (born Konstanty Borzęcki herbu Półkozic) wrote Les Turcs anciens et modernes (\"The Ancient and Modern Turks\") in Istanbul in 1869. That is considered one of the first works of Turkish nationalist political thought.\nNâzım Hikmet's maternal grandmother, Leyla Hanım, was the daughter of Mehmet Ali Pasha, of French Huguenot and German origin, and Ayşe Sıdıka Hanım, a daughter of Çerkes Hafız Paşa. Nâzım Hikmet and Celile Hanım's cousins included Oktay Rifat Horozcu, a leading Turkish poet, and the statesman Ali Fuat Cebesoy.\n\nEarly life\nNâzım was born on 15 January 1902, in Selânik (Salonica), where his father was serving as an Ottoman government official. He attended the Taşmektep Primary School in the Göztepe district of Istanbul and later enrolled in the junior high school section of the prestigious Galatasaray High School in the Beyoğlu district, where he began to learn French. However, in 1913, he was transferred to the Numune Mektebi, in the Nişantaşı district. In 1918, he graduated from the Ottoman Naval School on Heybeliada, one of the Princes' Islands, in the Sea of Marmara. His school days coincided with a period of political upheaval, during which the Ottoman government entered the First World War and was allied with Germany. For a brief period, he was assigned as a naval officer to the Ottoman Navy cruiser Hamidiye, but in 1919 he became seriously ill and was not being able to fully recover. That got him exempted from naval service in 1920.\nIn 1921, together with his friends Vâlâ Nureddin (Vâ-Nû), Yusuf Ziya Ortaç and Faruk Nafiz Çamlıbel, he went to İnebolu in Anatolia to join the Turkish War of Independence. From there he, together with Vâlâ Nûreddin, walked to Ankara, where the Turkish liberation movement was headquartered. In Ankara, they were introduced to Mustafa Kemal Pasha, later called Atatürk, who wanted the two friends to write a poem that would invite and inspire Turkish volunteers in Istanbul and elsewhere to join their struggle. The poem was much appreciated, and Muhittin Bey (Birgen) decided to appoint them as teachers to the Sultani (high college) in Bolu, rather than to send them to the front as soldiers. However, their communist views were not appreciated by the conservative officials in Bolu and so both of them decided to go to Batumi in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic to witness the results of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and arrived there on 30 September 1921. In July 1922, both friends went to Moscow, where Ran studied Economics and Sociology at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East in the early 1920s. There, he was influenced by the artistic experiments of Vladimir Mayakovsky and Vsevolod Meyerhold, as well as the ideological vision of Vladimir Lenin.\n\nStyle and achievements\nDespite writing his first poems in syllabic meter, Nazım Hikmet distinguished himself from the \"syllabic poets\" in concept. With the development of his poetic conception, the narrow forms of syllabic verse became too limiting for his style, and he set out to seek new forms for his poems.\nHe was influenced by the young Soviet poets who advocated Futurism. On his return to Turkey, he became the charismatic leader of the Turkish avant-garde by producing streams of innovative poems, plays and film scripts.In Moscow in 1922, he broke the boundaries of syllabic meter, changed his form and began writing in free verse.He has been compared by Turkish and non-Turkish men of letters to such figures as Federico García Lorca, Louis Aragon, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Pablo Neruda. Although Ran's work bears a resemblance to these poets and owes them occasional debts of form and stylistic device, his literary personality is unique in terms of the synthesis he made of iconoclasm and lyricism, of ideology and poetic diction.: 19 Many of his poems have been set to music by the Turkish composer Zülfü Livaneli and by Cem Karaca. Part of his work has been translated into Greek by Yiannis Ritsos, and some of the translations have been arranged by the Greek composers Manos Loizos and Thanos Mikroutsikos.\nBecause of his political views, his works were banned in Turkey from 1938 to 1965.\n\nLater life and legacy\nNâzım's imprisonment in the 1940s became a cause célèbre among intellectuals worldwide. A 1949 committee that included Pablo Picasso, Paul Robeson, and Jean-Paul Sartre campaigned for his release.\nOn 8 April 1950, Nâzım began a hunger strike to protest the Turkish Parliament's failure to include an amnesty law in its agenda before it closed for the upcoming general election. He was then transferred from the prison in Bursa, first to the infirmary of Sultanahmet Jail, in Istanbul, and later to Paşakapısı Prison. Seriously ill, Ran suspended his strike on 23 April, National Sovereignty and Children's Day. His doctor's request to treat him in hospital for three months was refused by officials. As his imprisonment status had not changed, he resumed his hunger strike on the morning of 2 May.Nâzım's hunger strike caused a stir throughout the country. Petitions were signed and a magazine named after him was published. His mother, Celile, began a hunger strike on 9 May, followed by the renowned Turkish poets Orhan Veli, Melih Cevdet and Oktay Rıfat the next day. In light of the new political situation after the 1950 Turkish general election, held on 14 May, the strike ended five days later, on 19 May, Turkey's Commemoration of Atatürk, Youth and Sports Day, when he was finally released by a general amnesty law enacted by the new government.On 22 November 1950, the World Council of Peace announced that Nâzım was among the recipients of the International Peace Prize, along with Pablo Picasso, Paul Robeson, Wanda Jakubowska and Pablo Neruda.Later on, Nâzım escaped from Turkey to Romania on a ship via the Black Sea and from there moved to the Soviet Union. Because the Soviet bloc recognized the Turkish minority only in communist Bulgaria, the poet's books were immediately brought out in this country, both in Turkish originals and in Bulgarian translations. The communist authorities in Bulgaria celebrated him in Turkish and Bulgarian publications as 'a poet of liberty and peace.' The goal was to discredit Turkey presented as a \"lackey of the imperialist\" United States in the eyes of Bulgaria's Turkish minority, many of whom desired to leave for or were expelled to Turkey in 1950–1953.When the EOKA struggle broke out in Cyprus, Ran believed that its population could live together peacefully, and he called on the Cypriot Turks to support the Greek Cypriots' demand for an end to British rule and union with Greece (enosis). Hikmet drew negative reaction from Turkish Cypriots for his opinions.Persecuted for decades by the Turkey during the Cold War for his communist views, Nâzım died of a heart attack in Moscow on 3 June 1963 at 6.30 a.m. while he was picking up a morning newspaper at the door of his summer house in Peredelkino, far away from his beloved homeland. He is buried in Moscow's Novodevichy Cemetery, where his tomb is still a place of pilgrimage for Turks and others from around the world. His final wish, which was never carried out, was to be buried under a plane tree (platanus) in any village cemetery in Anatolia.His poems depicting the people of the countryside, villages, towns and cities of his homeland (Memleketimden İnsan Manzaraları, \"Human Landscapes from my Country\"), as well as the Turkish War of Independence (Kurtuluş Savaşı Destanı, i.e. The Epic of the War of Independence\"), and the Turkish revolutionaries (Kuvâyi Milliye, \"Force of the Nation) are considered among the greatest literary works of Turkey.After his death, the Kremlin ordered the publication of the poet's first-ever Turkish-language collected works in communist Bulgaria, where a large and recognized Turkish national minority still existed. The eight volumes of these collected works, Bütün eserleri, appeared at Sofia between 1967 and 1972, in the very last years of the existence of the Turkish minority educational and publishing system in Bulgaria.\nNâzım had Polish and Turkish citizenship. The latter was revoked in 1959 and restored in 2009. His family has been asked if it wanted his remains repatriated from Russia.\n\nPatronage\nDuring the 1940s, as he was serving his sentence at Bursa Prison, painted. There, he met a young inmate, İbrahim Balaban. Ran discovered Balaban's talent in drawing, gave all his paint and brushes to him, and encouraged him to continue with painting. Ran influenced the peasant and educated him, who had finished only a three-grade village school, in forming his own ideas in the fields of philosophy, sociology, economics, and politics. Ran greatly admired Balaban and referred to him in a letter to the novelist Kemal Tahir as \"his peasant painter\" (Turkish: Köylü ressam). Their contact remained after they were released from the prison.\n\nSelected works\n\"I Come and Stand at Every Door\"\nNâzım's poem \"Kız Çocuğu\" (\"The Girl Child\") conveys a plea for peace from a seven-year-old girl, ten years after she perished in the atomic bomb attack at Hiroshima. It has achieved popularity as an anti-war message and has been performed as a song by a number of singers and musicians both in Turkey and elsewhere. It is also known in English by various other titles, including \"I Come and Stand at Every Door\", \"I Unseen\" and \"Hiroshima Girl\".\n\nTurkish\nZülfü Livaneli has performed a version of the original Turkish poem on his album Nazım Türküsü, which was later sung in Turkish by Joan Baez.\nFazıl Say included the poem in his Nazım oratorio in Turkish.\n\nBengali\nSubhash Mukhopadhyay (poet) translated Hikmet's poems into Bengali. The poems are collected in two anthologies, Nirbachita Nazim Hikmet (1952)(Selected Poems of Nazem Hikmet) ISBN 81-7079-501-X and Nazem Hikmet er Aro Kobita (1974) (More Poems of Nazem Himet). Some of the translations are available in open source.\n\nGreek\nThanos Mikroutsikos, in the album Politika tragoudia (Political Songs, 1975) composed a series of Hikmet's poems, adapted in Greek by the poet Yiannis Ritsos.\nManos Loizos composed settings of some of Ran's poems, adapted in Greek by Yiannis Ritsos. They are included in the 1983 disc Grammata stin agapimeni (Letters to the Beloved One).\n\nEnglish\nThe usual tune is a nontraditional melody composed by Jim Waters in 1954 to fit the lyrics of Child 113 ballad \"The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry\", which was recorded by American folksinger Joan Baez as \"Silkie\" on her second album Joan Baez, Vol. 2 in 1961.\nAccording to American activist folk musician Pete Seeger, Jeanette Turner did a loose English \"singable translation\" of the poem under a different title, \"I Come And Stand At Every Door\", and sent a note to Seeger asking \"Do you think you could make a tune for it?\" in the late 1950s. After a week of trial and failure, the English translation was used by Seeger in 1962 with an adaptation of \"an extraordinary melody put together by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology student, James Waters, who had put a new tune to a mystical ballad 'The Great Silkie' which he could not get out of his head, without permission.\" Seeger wrote in Where Have All the Flowers Gone: \"It was wrong of me. I should have gotten his permission. But it worked. The Byrds made a good recording of it, electric guitars and all.\" Seeger also used the track in his 1999 compilation album Headlines & Footnotes: A Collection Of Topical Songs. Seeger sang the song on 9 August 2013, the 68th anniversary of the Nagasaki atomic bombing, on a Democracy Now! interview.\nBritish folk singer Harvey Andrews recorded a version under the title \"Child of Hiroshima\" (sometimes re-released as \"Children of Hiroshima\"), released on his eponymous debut EP in 1965.\nThe Byrds; the American rock band used the translation on their third album Fifth Dimension in 1966.\nRoger McGuinn of the Byrds later recorded the song with its original lyrics as part of his Folk Den project.\nThe Misunderstood used the translation, changing the title to \"I Unseen\", on a 1969 UK Fontana single, later included in the 1997 anthology album Before The Dream Faded with their own tune.\nPaul Robeson recorded the song as \"The Little Dead Girl\" with another translation.The song was later covered by\n\nIvo Watts-Russell's supergroup, This Mortal Coil on their 1991 album Blood with vocals of Louise Rutkowski, Deirdre Rutkowski with Tim Freeman and 1983–1991.\nThe Fall on their 1997 album Levitate, albeit omitting the last verse and wrongly attributing writing credits to anon/J Nagle. \"I Come and Stand at Your Door\" listed as \"Anon/Nagle\", which is an interpretation of the song \"I Come and Stand at Every Door\". \"Jap Kid\" is an instrumental version of this track.\nSilent Stream Of Godless Elegy, a Moravian folk metal band, on their album Behind the Shadows in 1998.\nFaith & Disease on their 1998 album Insularia.\nAnne Hills on 1998 album Where Have All The Flowers Gone: The Songs of Peter Seeger.\nIbon Errazkin has an instrumental song with the same title on Esculea de arte.\nStyrofoam aka Arne Van Petegem's EP and first US release, RR20, included an instrumental version of the traditional tune of \"Great Silkie\" with the same title.\n\nJapanese\nIn 2005, famous Amami Ōshima singer Chitose Hajime collaborated with Ryuichi Sakamoto by translating \"Kız Çocuğu\" into Japanese, retitling it  Shinda Onna no Ko [死んだ女の子] \"A dead girl\"). It was performed live at the Atomic Bomb Dome in Hiroshima on the eve of the 60th Anniversary (5 August 2005) of Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The song later appeared as a bonus track on Chitose's album Hanadairo in 2006.\n\nNepali\nSome of Nâzım's poems are translated into Nepali by Suman Pokhrel and are published in print and online literary journals.\n\nOn the soldier worth 23 cents\nHow do you propose to get it? Do you want to get it through the cooperation of Turkey where the men in the ranks get 23 cents a month the first year and 32 cents the second year, or do you want to get an American division and equip it and send it over to Turkey which would cost you 10 times as much?\nHe also opposed the Korean War, in which Turkey participated. After the Senate address of John Foster Dulles, who served as U.S. Secretary of State under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, where he valued Turkish soldiers at 23 cents a month compared with the lowest echelon U.S. soldiers at $70, Nazım Hikmet Ran wrote a protest poem criticising the policies of the United States. This poem is titled \"23 Sentlik Askere Dair\" (On the soldier worth 23 cents).\n\nIn popular culture\nNâzım's poem \"We'll Give the Globe to the Children\" was set to music in 1979 by Russian composer David Tukhmanov.\nTale of Tales is a Russian animated film (1979) partially inspired by Hikmet's poem of the same name.\nFinnish band Ultra Bra recorded a song \"Lähettäkää minulle kirjoja\" (\"Send me books\")) based on a translated excerpt of Hikmet's poem \"Rubai\".\nThe Ignorant Fairies is a 2001 Italian film, in which a book by Hikmet plays a central plot role.\nMavi Gözlü Dev (Blue Eyed Giant) is a 2007 Turkish biographical film about Nazım Hikmet. The title is a reference to the poem Minnacık Kadın ve Hanımelleri. The film chronicles Nazim Hikmet's imprisonment at Bursa Prison and his relationships with his wife Piraye and his translator and lover Münevver Andaç. He is played by Yetkin Dikinciler.\nHikmet's poem was quoted in the 2012 Korean drama Cheongdam-dong Alice.\nThe video game Suzerain opens with a quote from Hikmet, and the character Bernard Circas is based on him. The game has elements inspired by modern Turkish history.\n\nBibliography\nPlays\nKafatası (1932, The Skull)\nUnutulan Adam (1935, The Forgotten Man)\nFerhad ile Şirin 1965 (Ferhad and Şirin)\nLüküs Hayat (Luxurious Living) (as ghostwriter)\n\nBallet libretto\nLegend of Love (by Arif Malikov) 1961\n\nNovels\nYaşamak Güzel Şey Be Kardeşim (1967, Life's Good, Brother)\nKan Konuşmaz (1965, Blood Doesn't Tell)\n\nPoems\n\"Taranta-Babu'ya Mektuplar\" (1935, \"Letters to Taranta-Babu\")\n\"Simavne Kadısı Oğlu Şeyh Bedreddin Destanı\" (1936, \"The Epic of Sheikh Bedreddin\")\n\"Memleketimden İnsan Manzaraları\" (1966–67, \"Human Landscapes from My Country\")\n\"Kurtuluş Savaşı Destanı\" (1965, \"The Epic of the War of Independence\")\n\nPoetry\nİlk şiirler / Nâzım Hikmet, İstanbul : Yapı Kredi, 2002.

He was the grandfather of the Turkish statesman Ali Fuat Cebesoy, and the great-grandfather of famous poets Nâzım Hikmet and Oktay Rıfat Horozcu and the socialist activist, lawyer, and athlete Mehmet Ali Aybar.\n\nBiography\nMehmed Ali was born as Ludwig Karl Friedrich Detroit (also known as Carl Detroy) in Magdeburg, Prussia. His parents were Carl Friedrich Detroit and Henriette Jeanette Severin. The French family name points to Huguenot ancestry, as a descendant of Protestant refugees from France in the 16th or 17th century. During his teenage years in 1843 he ran away to sea, and traveled to the Ottoman Empire, where he converted to Islam and was circumcised. There, in 1846, Âli Pasha, later Grand Vizier, sent him to a military school. He received a commission in the Ottoman Army in 1853 and fought against Russia in the Crimean War. He was made a brigadier general and Pasha in 1865.\n\nIn the 1877–1878 war against Russia, Mehmed Ali led the Turkish army in Bulgaria. He was successful in his operations on the Lom river (August–September 1877), but was afterward forced back by his opponents. He failed to effect a junction with Süleyman Hüsnü Pasha, and was superseded by the latter. Later in 1878 he was a participant at the Congress of Berlin.\n\nDeath\nIn August 1878, the Ottoman government selected him to overview the process of the cession of the Plav-Gucia region to Montenegro in compliance to the decisions of the Congress of Berlin. Mehmed Ali Pasha's first task was the pacification of the Albanian League of Prizren, which opposed the border change as part of the areas (Plav-Gucia/Plav-Gusinje) were inhabited by ethnic Albanians. He arrived in Kosovo in late August, attempting to make local Albanians comply with the Berlin Treaty but was blocked from any further movement towards the Ottoman-Montenegrin border by the local committees of the Albanian League. Stationed in Abdullah Pasha Dreni's estate in Gjakova with several Ottoman battalions he was killed on September 6 after a seven-day battle with several thousand Albanians opposing cession of Albanian inhabited lands to European powers.\n\nSources\n\n\n== Family tree ==",
