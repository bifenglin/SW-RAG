    "context": "Passage 1:\nLewiston Maineiacs\nThe Lewiston Maineiacs were a junior ice hockey team of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League based in Lewiston, Maine, United States. The team played its home games at the Androscoggin Bank Colisée.  They were the second QMJHL team in the United States, and the only one to play a full season. They won the President's Cup in 2007, becoming the only American based franchise to accomplish the feat.\nOn May 31, 2011, the QMJHL decided to fold the team following eight years of financial losses.\n\nHistory\nTheir franchise was granted for the 1969–70 season. They played in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, from 1969 to 1992. They were known as the Ducs from 1969 to 1973, and as the Draveurs from 1973 to 1992. They moved to Sherbrooke, Quebec, in 1992 to become the Faucons (1992–1998) and the Castors (1998–2003). The Castors moved to Lewiston, Maine, in 2003.\nThe MAINEiacs clinched the Jean Rougeau Trophy for first overall in the regular season for 2006–07. During the same season, Lewiston increased its annual attendance totals to 94,903 tickets sold. In the playoffs that year, Lewiston went 16–1 to cruise to their first President's Cup.\n\n2007 Memorial Cup\nAfter winning the 2007 President's Cup, the MAINEiacs won eligibility to play in the 2007 Memorial Cup in Vancouver, British Columbia. Following an opening win over the Medicine Hat Tigers, the MAINEiacs suffered a huge loss with the injury of their captain, Marc-André Cliche, and never really found their scoring touch. They crashed out of the tournament in fourth place after losing consecutive games to the Vancouver Giants, Plymouth Whalers, and the Whalers again in the tie-breaker, scoring only three goals in three games in the process.\n\nScoresSaturday, May 19: Lewiston 3, Medicine Hat Tigers 1\nSunday, May 20: Vancouver Giants 2, Lewiston 1\nTuesday, May 22: Plymouth Whalers 2, Lewiston 1 (OT)\nThursday, May 24: Plymouth Whalers 5, Lewiston 1\n\nSale and aborted relocation\nOn January 25, 2009, it was announced that the MAINEiacs were negotiating with the city of Boisbriand, Quebec (a suburb of Montreal), in hopes of relocating the franchise for the 2009–10 season. Under the plan, Mark Just would remain majority owner with 51% of the shares, with former NHL defenseman Joel Bouchard owning the rest. On January 31, the team announced that they had filed their intent to relocate, and had submitted papers to do so to the QMJHL.\nIn a January 31 media release announcing the move of the MAINEiacs franchise, owner Mark Just said that community support for the team was a major consideration. During the six seasons since the team moved from Sherbrooke, Quebec, to Lewiston, the MAINEiacs never managed to break even. However, on February 2, Farrel Miller, owner of the QMJHL's Montreal Junior Hockey Club, issued a statement that his team would fight the MAINEiacs move to Boisbriand on territorial grounds.\n\nThe Montreal Junior Hockey Club has communicated to the QMJHL that it will retain, without modification, its exclusive geographic territory that it acquired in connection with its 2008 Franchise Agreement with the QMJHL. On January 21, 2009, the Montreal Junior Hockey Club communicated to the Governors of the QMJHL that (i) it has chosen to retain its exclusive territory without modification and (ii) that it is not seeking any financial compensation in connection with this issue.After several weeks of negotiations with a number of Canadian cities (most notably Fredericton, New Brunswick), MAINEiacs Head Coach Don Macadam announced on March 24, 2009, that the MAINEiacs would be remaining in Lewiston. In June 2010, Lewiston businessman Paul Spellman became minority owner of the team, and in early August 2010, former Moncton Wildcats General Manager Bill Schurman was named as the team's Sports Management Consultant.  However, relocation rumors continued to follow the team, with Summerside, Prince Edward Island (where Schurman, a native of that town, had recently been the municipality's Director of Community Services), and St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, named as a potential destinations in January 2011.\nSchurman's denials of the team looking into a Summerside relocation proved unconvincing, and the rumours had a negative effect on attendance. However, Schurman's dream of moving the MAINEiacs to his home city ultimately failed, as a preliminary exploration to gauge support for a move to Summerside found little traction. The team then began to look at other possibilities, but found that few other relocation options existed.\nThe Lewiston franchise was disbanded by the QMJHL in the summer of 2011. To replace the defunct MAINEiacs club, the Sherbrooke Phoenix were scheduled to begin play for the 2012–13 season, the 3rd franchise to call Sherbrooke home in 25 years.\n\nTakeover by league and disbanding\nOn May 31, 2011, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League held a conference call to prepare an offer to purchase the team from Mark Just for 3.5 million dollars. Under the league's plan, the MAINEiacs would then be disbanded, with players being selected by other clubs in a dispersal draft. Late on May 31, the league issued a press release confirming the sale of the MAINEiacs to the league, and the subsequent disbanding / dispersal draft occurred the following week. Colisee stated they would search for a replacement team from outside of the QMJHL to take the MAINEiacs place.The City of Lewiston and the Androscoggin Bank Colisee would end up getting the American Hockey League's Portland Pirates to move to the Colisee for the 2013-14 season after disputing their lease with the Cumberland County Civic Center in Portland. Starting in 2019, the NAHL Maine Nordiques and their partner organization, the NA3HL Lewiston-Auburn Nordiques, began play at the Colisee.\n\nCoaches\nMario Durocher: 2003–04\nClément Jodoin: 2004–2007\nEd Harding: 2007 – January 12, 2009\nDon MacAdam: January 13, 2009 – December 10, 2009 [1]\nJeff Guay: interim: December 10, 2009 – December 27, 2009 (then moved to assistant coach).\nJean-François Houle: December 27, 2009 – May 31, 2011\n\nPlayers\nQMJHL award winners\nMike Bossy Trophy — best pro prospect: Alexandre Picard, 2004\nPaul Dumont Trophy — personality of the year: Clement Jodoin, 2006\nRon Lapointe Trophy — Coach of the Year: Clement Jodoin, 2007\nGuy Carbonneau Trophy — Best Defensive forward: Marc-André Cliche, 2007.\nGuy Lafleur Trophy — QMJHL playoff's Most Valuable Player: Jonathan Bernier, 2007\n\nAll-stars\nJonathan Paiement: 1st team (defense) 2003–04\nAlexandre Picard: 1st team (right wing) 2003–04,\nAlex Bourret: 2nd team (right wing) 2004–05\nJonathan Bernier: 2nd team (goaltender) 2006–07\nPeter Delmas: all-rookie team (goaltender) 2006–07\nStefano Giliati: 2nd team (left wing) 2007–08\nKevin Marshall: 2nd team (defense) 2007–08\n\nCaptains\n2003–04: Francis Trudel\n2004–05: No captain\n2005 – January 2006: Brandon Roach\nJanuary 2006 – May 2007: Marc-André Cliche\nSeptember 2007 – March 2008: Marc-André Daneau\nSeptember 2008 – June 2009: Danick Paquette\nSeptember 2009 – May 2010: Billy Lacasse\nSeptember 2010 – 2011: Cameron Critchlow\n\nNHL alumni\nNine MAINEiacs to date have played in the NHL:\n\nJonathan Bernier\nAntoine Bibeau\nMichael Chaput\nMarc-André Cliche\nÉric Gélinas\nJaroslav Halák\nKevin Marshall\nDavid Perron\nAlexandre Picard\n\nNHL draftees\nIn addition, the MAINEiacs have had several players drafted by National Hockey League teams.

They most recently played home games at the 550-seat Centennial Ice Arena and due to the arena's small size, the Bulls frequently sold out games. They previously played their home games in the Metrapark which had a max capacity of 9,000 for hockey games. However, a negotiating dispute with arena officials and local county commissioners resulted in the team losing its lease.\n\nHistory\nThe Bulls joined the American Frontier Hockey League in 1993 which became the America West Hockey League (AWHL) in 1998. The Bulls joined the Tier II Jr. A North American Hockey League in 2003 when the AWHL merged with the NAHL (keeping the NAHL name). The team played in the NAHL from 2003 to 2006 until the team and their rivals, the Bozeman Icedogs and Helena Bighorns, left to join the Northern Pacific Hockey League (NorPac), a regional league in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. When they joined the NorPac, the league was Tier III Junior B but promoted to Tier III Junior A by USA Hockey in 2007. In 2011, the Montana teams in the NorPac left the league to form the new regional American West Hockey League, made up of teams in Montana and Wyoming, including the Bulls. In March 2014, the new AWHL joined the North American 3 Hockey League (NA3HL) as the Frontier Division.On the opening weekend of the 2017–18 NA3HL season, the Bulls announced they would be going dormant due to lack of players. At the time, the Bulls were the second-oldest organization in the NA3HL, behind only the St. Louis Jr. Blues.\n\nPrevious leagues\n1993–1998 American Frontier Hockey League\n1998–2003 America West Hockey League\n2003–2006 North American Hockey League\n2006–2011 Northern Pacific Hockey League\n2011–2014 American West Hockey League\n2014–2017 North American 3 Hockey League\n\nSeason-by-season records\nNHL alumni\nThe franchise developed a number of collegiate and professional players, but only two have played in the NHL\nChris Holt, G (University of Nebraska-Omaha, last with Braehead Clan of the EIHL), formerly of the New York Rangers and St. Louis Blues.\nBrian Lee, D retired, formerly of the Tampa Bay Lightning and Ottawa Senators.\n\nOther notable alumni with professional or major college/junior experience\nJon Booras, F (Lake Superior State University, last with MAC Budapest of the MOL Liga)\nJacob Doty, F (currently with Braehead Clan of the EIHL)\nBrad Gorham, D (University of Alaska Anchorage, last with the Alaska Aces of the ECHL)\nTrevor Hammer, D (University of North Dakota, last played for Florida Seals)\nJeff Hazelwood, F (last played for Las Vegas Wranglers)\nJordan Hines, F (University of Findlay, last played for Fort Worth Fire)\nDan Knapp, D (University of Nebraska-Omaha, last played for Ontario Reign)\nMathias Lange, G (last played for the Iserlohn Roosters of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga)\nTom Reimann, D (University of Maine, last played for Colorado Eagles)\nCam Strong, F (currently with Dartmouth, NCAA Division 1)\nZach Tarkir, D (Northern Michigan University, last played for IF Troja/Ljungby of the HockeyAllsvenskan)\nKevin Ulanski, C (University of Denver, last played for the Bentley Generals)Stormy Knight, LW last played for Seattle Totems of the NPHL (current commisioner of The Mad House fantasy football league)\nPassage 3:\nCase Gym\nCase Gym is a 1,800-seat multi-purpose arena at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts. It opened in 1972 as part of the Harold Case Physical Education Center, which is named after the university's fifth president, Harold C. Case.\nThe gym is referred to as \"The Roof\" because it is located on the top level of the building, above Walter Brown Arena. It is home to the Boston University Terriers men's and women's basketball teams, as well as the men's wrestling team.   Basketball games are also played in Agganis Arena, and on occasion Walter Brown Arena. When Boston University left the America East Conference for the Patriot League in July 2013, they announced that all home men's basketball conference games would be played at Agganis Arena, with the non-conference games to be played at Case.Case Gym hosted the championship games of the 1997 and 2002 America East Conference men's basketball tournament as well as the championship game of the 2011 America East Conference women's basketball tournament. It has also hosted Ring Of Honor Wrestling Shows through wrestling promoter and Boston University alumnus Mike \"Mongoose\" Coughlin.The center, whose recreational use has declined since the opening of the Fitness and Recreation Center adjacent to Agganis Arena, is approximately located where the left field \"pavilion\" seats at Braves Field were before the Boston Braves, a Major League Baseball club, were relocated to Milwaukee in 1953.\n\nSee also\nList of NCAA Division I basketball arenas\nPassage 4:\nRobins Center\nThe Robins Center is a 7,201-seat multi-purpose arena in Richmond, Virginia. Opened in 1972, the arena is home to the University of Richmond Spiders basketball. It hosted the ECAC South (now known as the Colonial Athletic Association) men's basketball tournament in 1983.  It is named for E. Claiborne Robins Sr, class of 1931, who, along with his family, have been leading benefactors for the school.  The opening of the Robins Center returning Spider basketball to an on-campus facility for the first time since the mid-1940s when it outgrew Millhiser Gymnasium.  In the intervening decades, the Spiders played home games in numerous locations around the Richmond area, including the Richmond Coliseum (1971–1972), the Richmond Arena (1954–1971), the Benedictine High School gymnasium (1951–1954), Grays' Armory (1950–1951) and Blues' Armory (1947–1950). The Robins Center arena serves as the location of the University of Richmond's commencement exercises and hosted a 1992 Presidential debate involving Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Ross Perot.\nThe Robins Center saw a number of upgrades in the 2000s, including a new maple floor in 2003 and renovated locker rooms and offices in 2004. A new scoreboard and sound system was installed for the 2006–2007 season.  A $17 million renovation started in March 2013, which added four corner video boards, a repainted ceiling and new floor, and the seat capacity decreased from 9,071 to around 7,201 once renovations were completed in January 2014. \nIn 2015, the playing surface was renamed \"Dick Tarrant Court\" in honor of Dick Tarrant, the school's all-time winningest coach.In addition to the basketball arena, the Robins Center also serves as the home of many of the other athletic programs at the University of Richmond. The Robins Center Natatorium serves as the home of the women's swimming and diving team, while most of the other programs have their coaches' offices in the building. An addition to the Robins Center, known as the Weinstein Center for Fitness and Recreation, opened in January 2007 and provides expanded facilities for recreational use.\n\nSee also\nList of NCAA Division I basketball arenas\nPassage 5:\n2007 Memorial Cup\nThe 2007 MasterCard Memorial Cup was played in May 2007 in Vancouver, British Columbia, at the Pacific Coliseum. It was the 89th annual Memorial Cup competition and determined the major junior ice hockey champion of the Canadian Hockey League (CHL).  The tournament was competed between the WHL champion, the Medicine Hat Tigers; the OHL champion, the Plymouth Whalers; the QMJHL champion, the Lewiston Maineiacs; and the host team and tournament champion, Vancouver Giants, who were competing in their second consecutive national junior championship. The Memorial Cup tournament was a four team tournament with a round-robin format. The Giants won their first Memorial Cup, defeating Medicine Hat 3–1 in the second all-WHL final in tournament history (the first was in 1989).  The tournament set a new Memorial Cup attendance record with 121,561 fans attending the nine games.  The previous record of 84,686 was set at the 2003 tournament in Quebec City.\nThe tournament was the first to feature two league champions based in the United States, from Lewiston, Maine and Plymouth, Michigan, respectively. The only previous Memorial Cup to feature two American teams was the 1998 Memorial Cup, featuring the WHL champion, the Portland Winter Hawks and the host, the Spokane Chiefs. The 2007 MasterCard Memorial Cup was also the first to feature the two-referee system.\nThe Memorial Cup trophy's ties to Canadian military were evident when Canadian Forces units delivered it to the championship by sea, aboard HMCS Vancouver; by air, hoisted aboard a CH-149 Cormorant helicopter; and by land, via the armoured 39th Canadian Brigade Group Convoy.\n\nRound-robin standings\nRosters\nSchedule\nRound robin\nPlayoff round\nTie breaker\nSemi-final\nChampionship game\nLeading scorers\nLeading goaltenders\nGoalies Have To Play A Minimum Of 60 Minutes To Be Listed.\n\nAward winners\nStafford Smythe Memorial Trophy (MVP): Milan Lucic, Vancouver\nGeorge Parsons Trophy (Sportsmanship): Brennan Bosch, Medicine Hat\nHap Emms Memorial Trophy (Goaltender): Matt Keetley, Medicine Hat\nEd Chynoweth Trophy (Leading Scorer): Michal Repik, VancouverAll-star team\n\nGoal: Matt Keetley, Medicine Hat\nDefence: Brendan Mikkelson, Vancouver; Cody Franson, Vancouver\nForwards: Darren Helm, Medicine Hat; Michal Repik, Vancouver; Milan Lucic, Vancouver\n\nRoad to the cup\nOHL playoffs\nQMJHL playoffs\n†Shawinigan seeded 8th in Eastern division.\n\nWHL playoffs\nPassage 6:\nDwyer Arena\nThe Robert and Concetta Dwyer Arena houses two ice surfaces, both 200 x 85 ft., and pro shop on Niagara University's campus in Lewiston, New York, United States. The main rink can seat up to 1,400 people and is the home to the Niagara Purple Eagles men's ice hockey team, which plays in Atlantic Hockey. The arena was formerly home to the women's ice hockey team, which played in College Hockey America. \nThe building was built in 1996. Prior to the 1999–2000 season, major renovation took place as a result of a gift by Bob and Connie Dwyer, both 1965 graduates, who contributed $3 million for facilities upgrades. Locker and training rooms, players' lounge, and lobby were upgraded, while separate entrances for the main and auxiliary rinks, new pro shop, and new ticket office were arranged. In the summer of 2007 a premium seating section was added in the area formerly occupied by the Party Deck, and as a result, capacity was increased from 1,600 to 2,100. The current seating capacity is 1,400.\nIt hosted the College Hockey America 2002, 2008, and 2010 men's conference tournaments and the 2004 and 2008 women's conference tournaments.  Dwyer was home of the Buffalo Sabres Summer Development Camp in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 which featured young prospects and draft picks in the Sabres organization.  The arena co-hosted the 2011 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nPassage 7:\n2006–07 QMJHL season\nThe 2006–07 QMJHL season was the 38th season in the history of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.

The Colisée was built to replace St. Dominics Regional High School Arena, and initially constructed and operated by the Catholic parish of SS. Peter and Paul. Currently, it is the home of the Maine Nordiques of the North American Hockey League. The Colisee is also used for concerts, conventions and trade shows. There is 17,000 square feet (1600 m2) of exhibit space. For conventions, the Colisee can accommodate up to 4,800 patrons.\n\nHistory\nThe Maine Nordiques of the former professional North American Hockey League were the primary tenant at the Civic Center from 1973 to 1977. The Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association played exhibition games at the Civic Center.\nIn 2003, the Lewiston Maineiacs came to the Central Maine Civic Center. The Central Maine Civic Center was renamed to the Lewiston Colisée (from the French word for colosseum, similar to the Colisée de Québec) to distinguish it from the Cumberland County Civic Center, the Augusta Civic Center, and the Bangor Civic Center. In 2007, the Maineiacs won the Presidents Cup, the QMJHL league championship. They remain the only U.S.-based QMJHL team to win the Presidents Cup. The Maineiacs folded at the end of the 2010–11 QMJHL season and the Sherbrooke Phoenix was created in its place.The Federal Hockey League held five home games at the arena in 2011 and 2012. Due to renovations to the Cumberland County Civic Center, the Portland Pirates played at the Colisee during the 2012–13 AHL season for all but one of their home games.On December 16, 2014, it was announced the New Hampshire Fighting Spirit from the North American 3 Eastern Hockey League, a Tier III junior league, would relocate to Lewiston and play home games at the Colisee as the L/A Fighting Spirit (with the L/A standing for Lewiston-Auburn) beginning with the 2015–16 season. In 2016, the Fighting Spirit joined the North American 3 Hockey League.\nFirland Management, which had acquired the Colisee from the City of Lewiston in 2008, bought the Fighting Spirit in 2017 and rebranded the team as the Lewiston/Auburn Nordiques after the former professional team. In 2019, Cain, Darryl Antonacci, and Nolan Howe were granted an expansion team in the Tier II junior North American Hockey League and named the team the Maine Nordiques. In March 2020, Antonacci agreed to purchase the Colisée and the Tier III Nordiques from Cain. Antonacci folded the Tier III junior team and replaced it with Tier I youth teams.The naming rights to the venue were sold to Androscoggin Bank in 2006. In 2020, the rights expired, and the bank's name was removed from the venue the following year.\n\nOther uses\nAli vs. Liston fight\nOn May 25, 1965, the Youth Center was the venue for the WBC heavyweight boxing championship rematch between 34-year old former champ Sonny Liston and 23-year-old reigning champion Muhammad Ali.

The regular season, which consisted of 17 teams playing 68 games each, began in September 2011 and ended in March 2012. This season was Blainville-Boisbriand Armada's first season in the league, as the team relocated to Boisbriand from Verdun where they played as the Montreal Junior Hockey Club from 2008 to 2011. The league lost one of his charter teams when the Lewiston Maineiacs folded during after the previous season, the QMJHL later announce an expansion team to  Sherbrooke for the 2012–13 season. In the playoffs, the Saint John Sea Dogs became the seventh team in league history to capture consecutive President's Cup championships.\n\nRegular season\nDivision standings\nNote: GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; OTL = Overtime losses ; SL - Shootout losses ; GF = Goals for ; GA = Goals against; Pts = Points\n\nx - team has clinched playoff spot\ny - team is division leader\nz - team has clinched division\ne - team is eliminated from playoff contention\n\nScoring leaders\nNote: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\n\nLeading goaltenders\nNote: GP = Games played; TOI = Total ice time; W = Wins; L = Losses ; GA = Goals against; SO = Total shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\n\n2012 President's Cup playoffs\nFirst round\n(1) Saint John Sea Dogs vs. (16) Cape Breton Screaming Eagles\n(2) Shawinigan Cataractes vs. (15) Rouyn-Noranda Huskies\n(3) Blainville-Boisbriand Armada vs. (14) Gatineau Olympiques\n(4) Victoriaville Tigres vs. (13) Baie-Comeau Drakkar\n(5) Quebec Remparts vs. (12) Drummondville Voltigeurs\n(6) Halifax Mooseheads vs. (11) Moncton Wildcats\n(7) Rimouski Océanic vs. (10) Val-d'Or Foreurs\n(8) Chicoutimi Saguenéens vs. (9) Acadie–Bathurst Titan\nQuarter-finals\n(1) Saint John Sea Dogs vs. (13) Baie-Comeau Drakkar\n(2) Shawinigan Cataractes vs. (8) Chicoutimi Saguenéens\n(3) Blainville-Boisbriand Armada vs. (7) Rimouski Océanic\n(5) Quebec Remparts vs. (6) Halifax Mooseheads\nSemi-finals\n(1) Saint John Sea Dogs vs. (8) Chicoutimi Saguenéens\n(6) Halifax Mooseheads vs. (7) Rimouski Océanic\nQMJHL Championship\n(1) Saint John Sea Dogs vs. (7) Rimouski Océanic\nPlayoff scoring leaders\nNote: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\n\nPlayoff leading goaltenders\nNote: GP = Games played; Mins = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; GA = Goals Allowed; SO = Shutouts; SV& = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\n\nMemorial Cup\nTrophies and awards\nTeamPresident's Cup: Saint John Sea Dogs\nJean Rougeau Trophy - Regular Season Champions: Saint John Sea Dogs\nLuc Robitaille Trophy - Team that scored the most goals: Victoriaville Tigres\nRobert Lebel Trophy - Team with best GAA: Shawinigan CataractesPlayerMichel Brière Memorial Trophy - Most Valuable Player: Yanni Gourde, Victoriaville Tigres\nJean Béliveau Trophy - Top Scorer: Yanni Gourde, Victoriaville Tigres\nGuy Lafleur Trophy - Playoff MVP: Charlie Coyle, Saint John Sea Dogs\nJacques Plante Memorial Trophy - Top Goaltender: Mathieu Corbeil-Thériault, Saint John Sea Dogs\nGuy Carbonneau Trophy - Best Defensive Forward: Frederick Roy, Quebec Remparts\nEmile Bouchard Trophy - Defenceman of the Year: Jérôme Gauthier-Leduc, Rimouski Océanic\nKevin Lowe Trophy - Best Defensive Defenceman: Morgan Ellis, Shawinigan Cataractes\nMike Bossy Trophy - Top Prospect: Mikhail Grigorenko, Quebec Remparts\nRDS Cup - Rookie of the Year: Mikhail Grigorenko, Quebec Remparts\nMichel Bergeron Trophy - Offensive Rookie of the Year: Mikhail Grigorenko, Quebec Remparts\nRaymond Lagacé Trophy - Defensive Rookie of the Year: Zachary Fucale, Halifax Mooseheads\nFrank J.

Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure. Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since the 1930s. During the Great Depression, loan modification programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures.\nDuring the Subprime mortgage crisis, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.\n\nUnited States 1930s\nDuring the Great Depression in the United States a number of mortgage modification programs were enacted by the states to limit foreclosure sales and subsequent homelessness and its economic impact.  Because of the shrinkage of the economy, many borrowers lost their jobs and income and were unable to maintain their mortgage payments. In 1933, the Minnesota Mortgage Moratorium Act was challenged by a bank which argued before the United States Supreme Court that it was a violation of the contract clause of the Constitution. In Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, the court upheld the law imposing a mandatory mortgage modification.\n\nUnited States 2000s\nAccording to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chairman, Sheila C. Bair, looking back as far as the 1980s, \"the FDIC applied workout procedures for troubled loans out of bank failures, modifying loans to make them affordable and to turn nonperforming into performing loans by offering refinances, loan assumptions, and family loan transfers.\"The U.S. housing boom of the first few years of the 21st century ended abruptly in 2006. Housing starts, which peaked at more than 2 million units in 2005, plummeted to just over half that level. Home prices, which were increasing at double-digit rates nationally in 2004 and 2005, have fallen dramatically since (see Chart 1). As home prices decline, the number of problem mortgages, particularly in sub-prime and Alt-A portfolios, is rising. As of third quarter 2007, the percentage of sub-prime adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) that were seriously delinquent or in foreclosure reached 15.6 percent, more than double the level of a year ago (see Chart 2). The deterioration in credit performance began in the industrial Midwest, where economic conditions have been the weakest, but has now (2006–2007) spread to the former boom markets of Florida, California, and other coastal states.\nChart 1\n\nChart 2\n\nDuring 2007, investors and ratings agencies have repeatedly downgraded assumptions about sub-prime credit performance. A Merrill Lynch study published in July estimated that if U.S. home prices fell only 5 percent, subprime credit losses to investors would total just under $150 billion, and Alt-A credit losses would total $25 billion. On the heels of this report came news that the S&P/Case-Shiller Composite Home Price Index for 10 large U.S. cities had fallen in August to a level that was already 5 percent lower than a year ago, with the likelihood of a similar decline over the coming year.\nThe complexity of many mortgage-backed securitization structures has heightened the overall risk aversion of investors, resulting in what has become a broader illiquidity in global credit markets. These disruptions have led to a precipitous decline in sub-prime lending, a significant reduction in the availability of Alt-A loans, and higher interest rates on jumbo loans (see Chart 3). The tightening in mortgage credit has placed further downward pressure on home sales and home prices, a situation that now could derail the U.S. economic expansion.Chart 3\n\nResidential mortgage credit quality continues to weaken, with both delinquencies and charge-offs on the rise at FDIC-insured institutions.This trend, in tandem with upward pricing of hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans, falling home prices, and fewer refinancing options, underscores the urgency of finding a workable solution to current problems in the sub-prime mortgage market. Legislators, regulators, bankers, mortgage servicers, and consumer groups have been debating the merits of strategies that may help preserve home ownership, minimize foreclosures, and restore some stability to local housing markets.On December 6, 2007, an industry-led plan was announced to help avert foreclosure for certain sub-prime homeowners who face unaffordable payments when their interest rates reset. This plan provides for a streamlined process to extend the starter rates on sub-prime ARMs for at least five years in cases where borrowers remain current on their loans but cannot refinance or afford the higher payments after reset. An important component of the industry-led plan is detailed reporting of loan modification activity. Working with the United States Treasury Department and other bank regulators, the FDIC will monitor loan modification levels and seek adjustments to the protocols if warranted.\n\nLoss Mitigation Mediation (LMM) Program\nMediation is usually a great way for a plaintiff and defendant to sit down with a neutral arbiter to hash out their differences and come to a resolution that is usually better than continued litigation. Mediation is successful in all types of disputes including personal injury cases, contract disputes and even divorces. However, in these cases, circuit court judges will readily punish a party who fails to attend mediation or who attends but fails to comply with the mediation order.\nIn 2009, the Florida Supreme Court forced every Florida Circuit Court (the courts in which Foreclosure Lawsuits are heard), to implement a mediation program for homeowners facing Foreclosure. This program was called the “Residential Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation” (RMFM) Program. The idea was for lenders to provide an in-person or telephonic meeting with the Homeowner/Defendant in the presence of an impartial mediator to discuss the Foreclosure Lawsuit and possible alternatives (including Loan Modification, Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure, and Short Sale).The RMFM Program was cancelled in 2011 following widespread criticism of the program. The RMFM failed because it had no teeth, because judges were reluctant to punish the mortgage companies for failing to mediate in good faith, and because borrowers were not receiving the cooperation they needed from the banks. In short, the RMFM was a complete waste of time, not because mediation is a bad idea but because of the limited loss mitigation options and because most state court judges could not or would not enforce the program.In 2012, the Bankruptcy Court in the Middle District of Florida implemented its own version of the failed RMFM, but unlike the state court version, it has seen a much higher success rate. One Orlando bankruptcy attorney reported a 90% success rate, with 18% of his modifications involving principal reduction. Similar programs have also been instituted by Bankruptcy courts in New York and Rhode Island.Following the lead of the Middle District, the Southern District of Florida Bankruptcy Court has initiated its own loss mitigation mediation (“LMM”) program. The LMM Program kicked off on April 1, 2013 and unlike the Middle District, the Southern District's program has more requirements for all parties and includes debtors in all chapters, not just Chapter 13. Chapter 7 debtors may use LMM to request a surrender of the property (a real surrender that provides for a transfer of title). LMM may be used by Chapter 13 debtors to request and apply for modification through mediation or surrender of any property they no longer want to own.\nThe Southern District's program also includes the utilization of a document processing program called the DMM Portal. Participants in the LMM program will use this secure online portal for the exchange of documents and communication. This program will help ensure that documents sent between the lender and the borrower and not lost or misplaced. Instant uploads and verification of transmissions are a hallmark of the portal.\nElection to participate in the LMM program will suspend any pending motions for relief from stay (“MFR”). However, while an LMM is pending, debtors will be required to pay 31% of their gross monthly income through the Chapter 13 plan as an “adequate protection” payment. The fees a debtor will have to pay to participate in the program will typically include an $1,800 fee to their bankruptcy attorney for handling the modification through their Chapter 13 plan and an approximately $300 fee to the mediator.While the bankruptcy mediation program does not guarantee a residential loan modification, it does make it much harder for a mortgage servicer to reject a modification because of the stringent requirement to act in good faith. For instance, if a servicer rejects a HAMP application, it will have to explain why. Often, a rejection is based upon a miscalculation, a misinterpretation, or an oversight. In this program, the debtor's attorney can demand that the servicer's representative explain his calculations. Often, the mistakes are found and corrected, resulting in the modification being accepted.\nWhile mortgage modification and bankruptcy may not be the solution to all distressed mortgage problems, it will certainly provide an additional venue for homeowners in need. Applying for a modification through bankruptcy may provide relief from the dischargeable debts that are keeping the debtor from being able to make the mortgage payments and provide the lenders a guarantee that the borrower is no longer obligated by those burdens.\n\nStreamlined modification process\nThe adoption of this streamlined modification framework is an additional tool that servicers will now have to help avoid preventable foreclosures. This framework will not only help homeowners who receive a streamlined modification, but will also further address servicer capacity concerns by freeing up resources, helping ensure that borrowers do not fall through the cracks because servicers aren't able to get to them.This is the first time the industry has agreed on an industry standard. The benchmark ratio for calculating the affordable payment is 38 percent of monthly gross household income. Once the affordable payment is determined, there are several steps the servicer can take to create that payment – extending the term, reducing the interest rate, and forbearing interest. In the event that the affordable payment is still beyond the borrower's means, the borrower's situation will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis using a cash flow budget. This program resulted from a unified effort among the Enterprises, Hope Now and its 27 servicer partners, Treasury, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). In addition, we’ve drawn on the FDIC's experience and assistance from developing the IndyMac streamlined approach and have greatly benefited from the FDIC's input and example. To accommodate the need for more flexibility among a larger number of servicers, the Streamlined Modification Program does differ from the IndyMac model in a few areas. However, it uses the same fundamental tools to achieve the same affordability target.The Streamlined Modification Program (SMP) was developed in collaboration with the FHFA, the Department of Treasury, Freddie Mac, and members of the HOPE NOW Alliance.\n\nSMP eligibility criteria\nThe SMP eligibility criteria include:\n\nConforming conventional or jumbo conforming mortgage loans originated on or before January 1, 2008;\nAt least three payments past due;\nThe loan is secured by a one-unit property that is the borrower's primary residence;\nCurrent mark-to-market loan to value (LTV) of 90 percent or more; and\nProperty is not abandoned, vacant, condemned, or in a serious state of disrepair.\nSMP is designed to reduce distressed borrowers' monthly mortgage payments to an amount equal to 38 percent of their monthly gross income. To do so, servicers may, in the following order:\nCapitalize accrued interest, escrow advances and costs, if allowed by state law;\nExtend the term of the mortgage loan by up to 480 months;\nReduce the mortgage loan interest rate in increments of .125% to a fixed rate that is not less than 3% (if this exercise results in a below market rate, it will, after 5 years, step up in annual increments to a market rate);\nAs a last resort, provide for principal forbearance, which will result in a balloon payment fully due and payable upon borrower's sale of the property or payoff or maturity of the loan.Borrowers meeting the SMP eligibility requirements enter into a trial period in which they must make monthly loan payments equal to the proposed modified payment. Timely payments must be made for three consecutive months before a borrower's loan can be modified under the SMP.The \"Streamlined Modification Plan,\" or SMP, which is an expansion of what many lenders are already doing, was implemented starting December 15, 2008.\n\nIndyMAC plan\nWith the George W. Bush administration refusing to enact FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair's controversial loan modification plan, lawmakers are taking matters into their own hands.\nOffer proactive workout solutions designed to address borrowers who have the willingness but limited capacity to pay.Return the loan to a current status.\nCapitalize delinquent interest and escrow.\nModify the loan terms based on waterfalls, starting at a front-end 38 percent HTI ratio down to a 31 percent HTI ratio subject to a formal net present value (NPV) floor.\nReduce interest rate to as low as 3 percent.\nExtend, if necessary, the amortization and/or term of the loan to 40 years.\nForbear principal if necessary.Provide borrowers the opportunity to stay in their home while making an affordable payment for the life of the loan.Require the borrower to make one payment at the time of the modification.\nCap the interest rate at the Freddie Mac Weekly Survey rate effective as required to meet the target HTI ratio, fixing the adjusted rate and monthly payment amount for 5 years.\nStep up the initial interest rate gradually starting in year 6 by increasing it one percentage point each year until reaching the Freddie Mac Weekly Survey rate cap.Use a financial model with supportable assumptions to ensure investor interests are protected.Input borrower specific income information into the NPV Tool, which provides a real-time workout solution.\nPerform automated loan level underwriting across large segments of the portfolio to support pre-approved bulk mailings.\nVerify income information the borrower provided via check stubs, tax returns, and/or bank statements.\nCompare the cost of foreclosure to mitigate losses.\nMandate that the cost of the modification must be less than the estimated foreclosure loss.Borrower eligibilityThe loan is at least 60 days delinquent where the loan is considered one day delinquent on the day following the next payment due date. Many servicing contracts often contain a standard clause allowing the servicer to modify seriously delinquent or defaulted mortgages, or mortgages where default is “reasonably foreseeable”.\nForeclosure sale is not imminent and the borrower is currently not in bankruptcy, or has not been discharged from Chapter 7 bankruptcy since the loan was originated.\nThe loan was not originated as a second home or an investment property.\"We (IndyMac Bank) commend FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair for her leadership in developing a systematic loan modification protocol. FHFA, the GSEs and HOPE NOW relied heavily on the IndyMac model in developing this new protocol\".  \nAs history unfolds on the U.S. Housing and Finance crisis that caused the persistent recession, the (IndyMac Bank) bankruptcy and ensuing scandal are important to understand.  A dynamic interplay between social good, capital ownership and the rule of law is ongoing in the U.S. experiment with the democratic process.  Much of the business models of IndyMac and also the government backed FrannieMae and FreddieMac quasi-banks were based on concentrated debt.  This model became very high risk as it was based on the faulty assumption that housing values would increase.  In fact, the prevalence of their mortgages greatly fed the housing bubble with significant crossfunding and possible corruption to the government regulatory function through dramatic campaign funding contributions from these organizations.  In the less regulated business climate of the late 1800s, speculative bubbles were corrected by painful financial panics.  True understanding is yet to be documented for the speculative housing bubble of 2008, but federal government management has seemingly replaced the severity of a financial panic with a persistent yet less severe correction.  This correction is becoming known at the Great Recession.\n\nFannie Mae/Freddie Mac Plan\nIn the task at hand to make headway against foreclosures and the depressed housing market. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered a new phase on December 9, 2008 for a fast-track program meant to make \"hundreds of thousands of mortgages affordable to people who can't currently meet their monthly payments.\"Through the SMP, servicers may change the terms of a loan to reduce a borrower's first lien monthly mortgage payment, including taxes, insurance and homeowners association payments, to an amount equal to 38 percent of gross monthly income. The changes in terms may include one or more of the following:\nAdding the accrued interest, escrow advances and costs to the principal balance of the loan, if allowed by state law;\nExtending the length of the mortgage loan as appropriate;\nReducing the mortgage loan interest rate in increments of 0.125 percent to an interest rate that is not less than 3 percent. If the new rate is set below the market interest rate, after five years it  will step up in annual increments to either the original loan interest rate or the market interest rate at the time of the modification, whichever is lower;\nForbearing on a portion of the principal, which will require the borrower to make a balloon payment when the loan matures, is paid off, or is refinanced.\n\nEligibility requirements\nConforming conventional and jumbo conforming mortgage loans originated on or before January 1, 2009;\nBorrowers who are at least three or more payments past due and are not currently in bankruptcy;\nOnly one-unit, owner-occupied, primary residences; and\nCurrent mark-to-market loan-to-value ratio of 90 percent or more.\n\nNew servicer guidance\nFannie Mae's foreclosure prevention efforts have generally been made available to a borrower only after a delinquency occurs. Under Fannie Mae's new guidance, loan servicers can use foreclosure prevention tools to assist distressed borrowers when a borrower demonstrates the need. As noted above, these guidelines apply to borrowers who are still current in their payments, but whose default is reasonably foreseeable. This new guideline is effective immediately, and borrowers may obtain information on eligibility at MakingHomeAffordable.gov.\n\nHope for Homeowners Plan (HUD)/FHA\nThe HOPE for Homeowners Act (H4H) Program is effective for endorsements on or after October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2011.\nAffordability versus value:  lenders will take a loss on the difference between the existing obligations and the new loan, which is set at 96.5 percent of current appraised value.  The lender may choose to provide homeowners with an affordable monthly mortgage payment through a loan modification rather than accepting the losses associated with declining property values.\nBorrower eligibility:  Lenders that determine the H4H program is a feasible and effective option for mitigating losses will assess the homeowner's eligibility for the program:The existing mortgage was originated on or before January 1, 2008;\nExisting mortgage payment(s) as of March 1, 2008 exceeds 31 percent of the borrowers gross monthly income for fixed-rate mortgages; For ARMs, the existing mortgage payment(s) exceeds 31 percent of the borrowers gross monthly income as of March 1, 2008 OR the date of the new loan application.\nThe homeowner did not intentionally default, does not have an ownership interest in other residential real estate and has not been convicted of fraud in the last 10 years under Federal and state law; and\nThe homeowner did not provide materially false information (e.g., lied about income) to obtain the mortgage that is being refinanced into the H4H mortgage.\n\nOriginal cost\n3 percent upfront mortgage insurance premium and a 1.5 percent annual premium,\nEquity and appreciation sharing with the Federal government, and\nProhibition against new junior liens against the property unless they are directly related to property maintenance.The HUDS fact sheet gives full details.\n\nUpdated Hope for Homeowners improvements\nEliminates 3% upfront premium\nReduces 1.5% annual premium to a range between .55% and .75%, based on risk-based pricing (also makes technical fix to permit discontinuation of fees when loan balance drops below certain levels, consistent with normal FHA policy)\nRaises maximum loan to value (LTV) from 90% to 93% for borrowers above a 31% mortgage debt to income (DTI) ratio or above a 43% ratio\nEliminates government profit sharing of appreciation over market value of home at time of refi. Retains government declining share (from 100% to 50% after five years) of equity created by the refi, to be paid at time of sale or refi as an exit fee\nAuthorizes payments to servicers participating in successful refis\nAdministrative simplification:\neliminates borrower certifications regarding not intentionally defaulting on any debt,\neliminates special requirement to collect two years of tax returns,\neliminates originator liability for first payment default,\neliminates March 1, 2008 31% debt-to-income ratio (DTI) test,\neliminates prohibition against taking out future second loans,\nrequires Board to make documents, forms, and procedures conform to those under normal FHA loans to the maximum extent possible consistent with statutory requirements.\n\nTroubled Assets Relief Program\nThe Troubled Assets Relief Program is a systematic foreclosure prevention and mortgage modification program established by the Secretary, in consultation with the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the FDIC and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that—\n\nProvides lenders and loan servicers with certain compensation to cover administrative costs for each loan modified according to the required standards; and\nProvides loss sharing or guarantees for certain losses incurred if a modified loan should subsequently re-default.\n\nCommitment of resources\nThe comprehensive plan established pursuant to subsection (a) shall require the commitment of funds made available to the Secretary under title I of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 in an amount up to $100,000,000,000 but in no case less than $40,000,000,000.In a press conference Tuesday, Federal Housing Finance Agency director James Lockhart said the program would target high-risk borrowers — those 90 or more days delinquent on their mortgages — and employ various modification strategies to get borrowers down to an “affordable” mortgage payment, defined as 38 percent of a household's monthly gross income on a first mortgage payment.\n\nAnalysis of the results of the government-sponsored programs\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision reported on 2009-04-03\n\n\"Nearly one in four loan modifications in the fourth quarter actually resulted in increased monthly payments\".  This can occur when late fees or past-due interest are added to the monthly payment.\nThe redefault rate was about 50 percent where the monthly payment was unchanged or increased, and 26 percent where the payment was decreased.\n\nHome Affordable Modification Program\nProgram Formed\nPurpose\nThe Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) was established on February 18, 2009 to help up from 7 to 8 million struggling homeowners at risk of foreclosure by working with their lenders to lower monthly mortgage payments. The Program is part of the Making Home Affordable Program which was created by the Financial Stability Act of 2009. The program was built as collaboration with banks, services, credit unions, the FHA, the VA, the USDA and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, to create standard loan modification guidelines for lenders to take into consideration when evaluating a borrower for a potential loan modification.  Over 110 major lenders have already signed onto the program.  The Program is now looked upon as the industry standard practice for lenders to analyze potential modification applicants.Early 2012 the Treasury redesigned the HAMP as Tier 1 for the original first-lien modification process and on June 1, 2012 Tier 2 became available. Tier 2 is for either owner-occupied properties or rental properties. For mortgages secured by rental properties, only those that are two or more payments delinquent are eligible.\n\nEligibility requirements\nThe program abides by the following eligibility and verification criteria: \n\nLoans originated on or before January 1, 2009\nFirst-lien loans on owner-occupied properties with unpaid principal balance up to $729,750\nHigher limits allowed for owner-occupied properties with 2-4 units\nAll borrowers must fully document income, including signed IRS 4506-T, proof of income (i.e. paystubs or tax returns), and must sign an affidavit of financial hardship\nProperty owner occupancy status will be verified through borrower credit report and other documentation; no investor-owned, vacant, or condemned properties\nIncentives to lenders and servicers to modify at risk borrowers who have not yet missed payments when the servicer determines that the borrower is at imminent risk of default\nModifications can start from now until December 31, 2016; loans can be modified only once under the program\n\nLoan modification terms and procedures\nParticipating servicers are required to service all eligible loans under the rules of the program unless explicitly prohibited by contract; servicers are required to use reasonable efforts to obtain waivers of limits on participation.\nParticipating loan servicers will be required to use a net present value (NPV) test on each loan that is at risk of imminent default or at least 60 days delinquent. The NPV test will compare the net present value of cash flows with modification and without modification. If the test is positive: meaning that the net present value of expected cash flow is greater in the modification scenario: the servicer must modify absent fraud or a contract prohibition.\nParameters of the NPV test are spelled out in the guidelines, including acceptable discount rates, property valuation methodologies, home price appreciation assumptions, foreclosure costs and timelines, and borrower cure and redefault rate assumptions.\nServicers will follow a specified sequence of steps in order to reduce the monthly payment to no more than 31% of gross monthly income (DTI).\nThe modification sequence requires first reducing the interest rate for trial period of 3–9 months(subject to a rate floor of 2%), then if necessary extending the term or amortization of the loan up to a maximum of 40 years, and then if necessary forbearing principal. Principal forgiveness or a Hope for Homeowners refinancing are acceptable alternatives.\nIt is noteworthy that this interest rate is not fixed, and will generally increase 1%/year until it reaches what ever the current rate is 5 years after the modification. Often it includes a balloon payment at the end of the first 5 years.  This practice has been found controversial by many in the financial world as it is expected to bring about a slurry of new foreclosures in 5 years when homeowners will once again not be able to pay their mortgage due to the interest rate hike, or the balloon payment.\nThe monthly payment includes principal, interest, taxes, insurance, flood insurance, homeowner's association and/or condominium fees.

Scammers make promises that they cannot keep, such as guarantees to “save” your home or lower your mortgage, often for a fee. Scammers may pretend that they have direct contact with your mortgage servicer when they do not.Even amongst reputable refinance organizations, the fundamental education of the house owner is not stressed.  Some may even request struggling homeowners to pledge their time to become politically active.  The controversy exists between personal integrity and the concept of a 'right to homeownership'.  Many euphemisms are used to implicitly stress the concept that homeownership is not the result of a lifetime of effort but a government-given right.  These euphemisms like \"HOPE, relief and Save-the-Dream\" as used above in naming or implementing the loan modification programs.

At the foundation of homeownership should be a personal long-term commitment to pay the terms of the mortgage.
