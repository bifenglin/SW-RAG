See the article on game classification for other alternatives, or see Category:Board games for a list of board game articles.\n\nSingle-player board games\nSome board games have solo variants, such as Arkham Horror and Agricola. Others are specifically designed for one player.\n\nTwo-player abstract strategy games\nIn abstract strategy games, players know the entire game state at all times, and random generators such as dice are not used.\n\nTwo-player board games\nMulti-player elimination board games\nParticipants are typically eliminated before game end.\n\nEuropean race games\nMultiplayer games without elimination\nEveryone can play along to the end. These games are especially suited for mixed play with adults and children.\n\nEconomics strategy games\nGames involving scarce resources and strategy.\n\nGames of physical skill\nCoordination, finesse, or other physical skills are necessary. Also known as dexterity games.\n\nChildren's games\nThe rules are easy to learn and the outcome is mostly or entirely due to chance.\n\nCooperative games\nCooperative games in which all players need to work together to win.\n\nWord games\nThese games are based on construction of words to score points.\n\nGaming systems\nThese are sets that can be used to play multiple games.\n\nSee also\nSpiel des Jahres (Game of the Year)\nGames 100\nList of board wargames\nList of Japanese board games\nList of mancala games\nList of board game publishers\nList of game manufacturers\nList of cross and circle games\n\nExternal links\nBoard Game Geek\nBoardgames.org\nA Zen Guide to Board Games\nGamerate Game database\nBoard Games Land\nBoard Game Theories\nPassage 2:\nClans (board game)\nClans is a German-style board game designed by Leo Colovini. The game centers on the creation of villages.\n\nGameplay\nAt the start of the game, each player is secretly dealt a card that has one of five colors on it - red, yellow, blue, green, or black. Although each player knows his own color, but not color of any of the other players. The game begins with one hut on each space, the colors being randomly distributed across the huts. On his turn, a player moves all of the huts from one space to another space. When a group of huts is completely isolated (all the surrounding spaces are empty) that space is scored. Scoring is different based on the terrain that those huts are on. The person with the most huts on that space, and anyone tied for the most, gets points. The game ends when the moves have been exhausted.\n\nAwards\nNominee for the Spiel des Jahres, 2003\n3rd in the Deutscher Spiele Preis, 2002\nGames magazine Best Abstract Strategy Game of 2003\nWinner, game of the year \"stoner award 2018 Leeuwarden\".\n\nExternal links\nClans   at BoardGameGeek\nPassage 3:\nDrunter und Drüber\nDrunter und Drüber (German: [ˈdʁʊntɐ ʊn ˈdʁyːbɐ], lit. \"under and over\", fig. \"haywire\") is a multiplayer board game invented by Klaus Teuber, first published in 1991 in Germany by Hans im Glück. A second edition was released in 1994 by Hans im Glück and featured art by Franz Vohwinkel.  The game was repackaged and rethemed as the western game Wacky Wacky West in 2010.\n\nGameplay\nPlayers take on the role of the people of Schilda and work to build a new town after they burned down their old one. Buildings are already completed and each player is secretly assigned one of six types of buildings, that each appear five times on the board. Buildings closer to the center of the board have a higher point value. Each player is given an identical set of vote cards that are worth varying degrees of yes or no. Every turn, players lay down tiles of streets, rivers, and town walls which add on to existing pieces. Buildings can be covered by tiles, but when someone attempts to build over an outhouse everyone votes on whether to allow it or not. If there are more negative votes, the tile does not get played. Each player tries to keep his or her buildings uncovered. The game ends when all the pieces have been placed or all players pass consecutively; then everyone tallies their score from their remaining buildings on the map and the player with the highest score wins.\n\nAwards\nSpiel des Jahres Game of the Year 1991\nDeutscher Spiele Preis 1991 3rd place\n\nReviews\nReview by Doug Adams\nReview by Debbie Pickett\nReview from Sumo, Issue 5, June 1991\nPassage 4:\nAlex Randolph\nAlexander Randolph (4 May 1922 – 27 April 2004) was a Bohemian-American designer of board games and writer. Randolph's game creations include TwixT, Breakthru, Hol's der Geier, Inkognito (with Leo Colovini), Raj, Ricochet Robot, and Enchanted Forest (with Michael Matschoss).\n\nBiography\nRandolph was a son of self-described \"rich parents\" who attended private school in Switzerland.\nHe spent his early years in various occupations, including military intelligence and as an advertising copy editor in Boston.In 1961, Randolph moved to Japan and became a professional game developer, performing initial work on TwixT. During this time, he became a dan player in shogi.\nIn 1962, Randolph (along with Sid Sackson) was commissioned to start a new game division for Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (also known as 3M). Through 3M, Randolph created and published such games as Breakthru, Evade, Oh-Wah-Ree, and TwixT.Randolph moved to Venice, Italy in 1968, continuing his career as a game developer with the company Venice Connection established with Dario De Toffoli and Leo Colovini.Randolph died aged 82 in Venice on 27 April 2004.\n\nRecognition\nIn 2016, as a testimony to his career, Fabulous Games published ADDX – the first ever digital game from Alex Randolph.Following Randolph's death, the Nuremberg Museum set up a special permanent collection of Randolph's games titled the Alexander Randolph Viewing Collection.\n\nAwards\nSpiel des Jahres\nGame of the Year\n\n1982 for Enchanted ForestChildren's Game of the Year\n\n1989 for Gute Freunde\n1997 for Leinen Los!Special Awards\n\n1996 Most Beautiful Game for Venice Connection\n1988 Most Beautiful game for Inkognito\n\nOrigins Awards Hall of Fame\nHall of Fame\n\n2011 induction as a designer\n2011 induction of TwixT\nPassage 5:\nFamilienbande\nFamilienbande (German for Family Ties) is a card game designed by Leo Colovini.  \nFamilienbande is a game of family inheritance, not of money, but of genetic traits.  The card deck in Familienbande features an equal number of men and women.  Each person on a card has three characteristics, chosen from a set of five, namely big ears, orange hair, thick lips, a big nose and glasses (to represent nearsightedness).  A card's characteristics need not be different, so, for example, a man could have two symbols for big ears and one for orange hair, or three \"glasses\" symbols.\n\nGameplay\nEach player represents a \"family\" in which one of the genetic traits is dominant, and therefore wishes to pass along this trait to as many children as possible (and as many times as possible in each child).  On each player's turn he or she can do one of three things: \n\n(1) Draw a card.\n(2) Play a card that forms a marriage, i.e. is paired with a card of the opposite sex, after which the player then draws a card.\n(3) Play a card as a child of a marriage that is already on the board.  Most importantly, the three genetic characteristics of a child must be included in the six characteristics of its parents (e.g. so a child's one \"ear\" and two \"lips\" traits must be appear in its parents' six genetic traits).  Every trait symbol on the child's card scores one point for that genetic trait times the generation number of that child.  After scoring, the player may then discard a card from his or her hand, and then draw a replacement.The game ends when the seventh child is played in the fifth \"generation\".\n\nBluffing\nThe genetic trait of the each player's \"family\" is chosen randomly at the start of the game, being kept hidden from all other players and only revealed at the end of the game.  The scores of all five genetic characteristics are tracked throughout the course of the game (even if there are only two players), allowing players to bluff and misdirect their opponents.  \nAt the end of the game, players reveal their own genetic trait and are penalized for cards left in hand, the winner being\nthe one with the highest score.\n\nExternal links\nFamilienbande   at BoardGameGeek\nIndependent review of Familienbande at juegos.games\nIndependent review of Familienbande\nPassage 6:\nInkognito\nInkognito is a board game for 3 to 5  players designed by Alex Randolph and Leo Colovini first published in 1988 by Milton Bradley Company. It has since been republished several times including by the company Venice Connection established by the designers and Dario De Toffoli.The game was inspired by the Italian card game Briscola Chiamata.\n\nPlay Overview\nInkognito is a spy game set in Venice. It is unique in that the players play in pairs, but no player knows who their partner is.  Each player has half of a secret message detailing their party's mission; their partner is the player with the other half. In order to win, a player must:\n\nfigure out who their partner really is\nget the other half of the secret message from their partner\ndiscover their party's mission\ncomplete the missionWith 5 players, one player plays as the ambassador, who wins if he can perfectly identify all the other players.\n\nAwards\nIn 1988 this game won the Spiel des Jahres special award for most beautiful game.\n\nReviews\nJeux & Stratégie #57 (as \"Intrigues à Venise\")\nPassage 7:\nLeo Colovini\nLeo Colovini is an Italian designer of German-style board games born in Venice 1964. His most popular game is Cartagena. He is one of the few top board game designers who has owned a game store.\nHis life in games was strongly influenced by meeting Alex Randolph at the age of 12 with whom he worked on several of his games. He has also been part of studiogiochi, an Italian games company, and has also collaborated with Dario De Toffoli and has written books on games.\n\nList of Games\nComplete list of games that Colovini has created:\n\nHis games are known for their simplicity and drama as this quote from Board Game Geek illustrates:  \"Carcasonne: The Discovery is also the simplest and most vanilla of the Carcassonnes. (Of course, if you know anything about Leo Colovini, you'd expect that.) But, it also the most tense Carcassonne. (And if you know Mr. Colovini, you also knew THAT!)\"\nPassage 8:\nFrancis Tresham (game designer)\nFrancis Tresham (1936 – 23 October 2019) was a British board game designer who produced board games since the early 1970s. Tresham founded and ran games company Hartland Trefoil (founded 1971), a company well-known for its Civilization board game, until its sale to MicroProse in 1997. His 1829 game was the first of the 18xx board game series and some of his board games inspired Sid Meier computer games such as Railroad Tycoon.\nFrancis Tresham was the first to introduce a technology tree into his boardgames. This idea had a large influence on later board and computer games.\nHe was managing director of Tresham Games, which produced 18xx-style board games. In 2013, he was one of the first inductees in the UK Games Expo Hall of Fame. He died on 23 October 2019.\n\nPublished board games\n1825\n1829\n1829 Mainline\n1830\n1853\nCivilization\nRevolution: The Dutch Revolt 1568–1648\nShocks & Scares\nSpanish Main\nThe Game of Ancient Kingdoms\nPassage 9:\nDavid Parlett\nDavid Parlett (born 18 May 1939 in London) is a games scholar, historian, and translator from South London, who has studied both card games and board games.

For example: in checkers, if a player jumps an opponent's piece, that piece is captured. Captured pieces are typically removed from the game. In some games, captured pieces remain in hand and can be reentered into active play (e.g. shogi, Bughouse chess).

E.g. the box itself, the board, the cards, the tokens, zipper-lock bags, inserts, rule books, etc. See also equipment.\n\ncounter  \nSee piece.\n\ncurrency  \nA scoring mechanic used by some games to determine the winner, e.g. money (Monopoly) or counters (Zohn Ahl).\n\ncustodian capture \nA capture method whereby an enemy piece is captured by being blocked on adjacent sides by opponent pieces. (Typically laterally on two sides as in Tablut and Hasami shogi, or laterally on four sides as in Go. Capture by blocking on two sides diagonally is done in Stone Warriors, and surrounding on three sides is required in Bizingo.) Also called escort capture and interception capture.\n\ncustodian method \nSee custodian capture.\n\nD\ndeck  \nA stack of cards.\n\ndie  \nsing. of dice.\n\ndice  \nModern cubic dice are used to generate random numbers in many games – e.g. a single die in Trivial Pursuit, or two dice per player in backgammon.

The (usually quadrilateral) marked surface on which one plays a board game. The namesake of the board game, gameboards would seem to be a necessary and sufficient condition of the genre, though card games that do not use a standard deck of cards (as well as games that use neither cards nor a gameboard) are often colloquially included. Most games use a standardized and unchanging board (chess, Go, and backgammon each have such a board), but some games use a modular board whose component tiles or cards can assume varying layouts from one session to another, or even during gameplay.\n\ngame component  \nSee component.\n\ngame equipment  \nSee equipment.\n\ngame piece  \nSee piece.\n\ngameplay  \nThe execution of a game; or specifically its strategy, tactics, conventions, or mechanics.\n\ngamer  \nA person who plays board game(s).

Antonym: out of play.\n\ninterception capture  \nSee custodian capture.\n\nintervention capture  \nA capture method the reverse of the custodian method: a player captures two opponent pieces by moving to occupy the empty space between them.\n\nJ\njump  \nTo move a piece over one or more pieces or spaces on the gameboard. Depending on the context, jumping may include  capturing an opponent's piece. See also Game mechanics § Capture/eliminate.\n\nL\nleap  \nSee jump.\n\nM\nman  \nIn chess, a piece or a pawn.

A player's representative on the gameboard made of a piece of material made to look like a known object (such as a scale model of a person, animal, or inanimate object) or otherwise general symbol. Each player may control one or more pieces. Some games involve commanding multiple pieces, such as chess pieces or Monopoly houses and hotels, that have unique designations and capabilities within the parameters of the game; in other games, such as Go, all pieces controlled by a player have the same capabilities. In some modern board games, such as Clue, there are other pieces that are not a player's representative (i.e. weapons). In some games, such as mancala games, pieces may not represent or belong to any particular player. Mancala pieces are undifferentiated and  typically seeds but sometimes beans, coins, cowry shells, ivory balls, or pebbles. Note that in chess usage the term piece in some contexts only refers to some of the pieces, which are also known as chessmen.

Alternatively, a unique position on the board on which a piece in play may be located. For example, in Go, the pieces are placed on grid line intersections called points, and not in the areas bounded by the borders, as in chess. The bounded area geometries can be square (e.g. chess), rectangular (e.g. shogi), hexagonal (e.g. Chinese Checkers), triangular (e.g. Bizingo), quadrilateral (e.g. three-player chess), cubic (e.g. Raumschach), or other shapes (e.g. Circular chess). Cf. gamespace. See also Game mechanics § Movement.\n\nsquare  \nSee space.\n\nstaging area  \nA space set aside from the main gameboard to contain pieces in hand.
