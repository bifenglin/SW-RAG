    "context": "Passage 1:\nFitz and The Tantrums\nFitz and the Tantrums are an American indie pop and neo soul band from Los Angeles, California, that formed in 2008. The band consists of Michael Fitzpatrick (lead vocals), Noelle Scaggs (co-lead vocals and percussion), James King (saxophone, flute, keyboard, percussion and guitar), Joseph Karnes (bass guitar), Jeremy Ruzumna (keyboards) and John Wicks (drums and percussion) who left the band in 2022 to teach at University of Montana. Their debut studio album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, was released in August 2010 on indie label Dangerbird Records and received critical acclaim. It reached no. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. The band signed to their current label Elektra Records in early 2013 and went on to release their second LP, More Than Just a Dream, the same year. Their self-titled third album was released in 2016, which contains their most notable song, \"HandClap\". Their fourth studio album, All the Feels, was released in 2019.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nFitz and the Tantrums was founded by Michael Fitzpatrick in 2008. Having purchased an old Conn electronic organ, he was inspired to write the song \"Breakin' the Chains of Love\" that same night. He contacted his college friend, saxophonist James King, who recommended singer Noelle Scaggs and former drummer John Wicks who left the band in 2022. In turn, King brought in bassist Joseph Karnes and keyboardist Jeremy Ruzumna. According to Fitzpatrick, the band immediately clicked. He has said, \"It was literally like five phone calls, one rehearsal, and we could have played a show that night.\" The band performed their first show at Hotel Café in Hollywood, in December 2008, which Fitzpatrick booked one week after their first rehearsal. In interviews, he has stated the importance of booking a date before the band was ready, in order to bring out the best in all performers. During the first half of 2009, they performed at several clubs in Los Angeles, including The Viper Room and Spaceland. Before Joseph Karnes was brought into the band, the previous bassist, Ethan Phillips was with the band for the first EP, and a part of their first album, \"Pickin' Up The Pieces\".\n\nThe band recorded their debut EP, Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, during the first half of 2009 at Fitzpatrick's home in Los Angeles. The EP was first released on August 11, 2009, through Canyon Productions. In September 2009 they toured with Hepcat and Flogging Molly. In November 2009 the band opened eight concerts on the Maroon 5's Back to School Tour. Their appearance was on short notice, after previously scheduled opener K'naan cancelled due to fatigue in late October. According to Fitzpatrick, \"Adam Levine from Maroon 5 was in New York to get a tattoo, and his favorite tattoo artist had downloaded the record after hearing us on the radio. He told Adam, 'you gotta hear this band.' A week and a half later, we're opening for Maroon 5 on their college tour.\" In December 2009 the band shot the official music video for their first single, \"Breakin' the Chains of Love\", which was directed by Joshua Leonard. It features Fitzpatrick and Scaggs in a moving and rotating bed.\n\nPickin' Up the Pieces\nIn March 2010 Fitz and the Tantrums played at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. On April 15, 2010, they opened for ska band The Specials on their North American reunion tour at Club Nokia in Los Angeles. On April 26, 2010, Dangerbird Records announced that they had signed Fitz and the Tantrums. Their first full-length album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, was released on August 24, 2010. Producer Chris Seefried was also a co-writer on the album. In October 2010, Daryl Hall invited the band to perform on his web-series Live from Daryl's House. They played a seven-song set including four Fitz and the Tantrums songs, early Hall song \"Girl I Love You\", \"Perkiomen\" and finishing with \"Sara Smile\". \"I walked back into the kitchen of his big old house in upstate New York, and his mother was there,\" recalled Fitzpatrick. \"She said, 'Fitz, come over here. You sound just like my son!'\"\nThe band performed the songs \"MoneyGrabber\" and \"Don't Gotta Work It Out\" on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! in Los Angeles on January 12, 2011. On February 28 they performed \"MoneyGrabber\" on TBS' Conan, and on April 5 on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. In 2011 the band announced a U.S. and international tour with April Smith and the Great Picture Show. In the fall of 2011, they made their first appearance at Austin City Limits Music Festival. On Friday, February 3, 2012, they performed \"Don't Gotta Work It Out\" on NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, episode 581, taped for broadcast at the Hilbert Circle Theatre in Indianapolis. They performed a free show at Thursday at the Square in Buffalo, New York, on June 14, 2012, and at the Basilica Block Party in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on July 7, 2012.\n\nMore Than Just a Dream\nThe band's second LP, More Than Just a Dream, was released May 7, 2013, on Elektra Records. It was produced by Tony Hoffer. The album features the lead single \"Out of My League\", which reached number one on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart on September 30, 2013. A French version of \"Out of My League\" was also released and played on Canadian radio. This version has most of the verses sung in French, while the chorus remains in English. The second single from More Than Just a Dream, \"The Walker\", also reached number one on the Billboard Alternative songs chart. In October 2014 Fitz and the Tantrums returned to the Austin City Limits Music Festival and played both weekends of the expanded festival.\n\nFitz and the Tantrums\nIn March 2016, the band released the lead single, \"HandClap\", off their self-titled album. The album was released on June 10, 2016, and was supported by the 2016 Get Right Back Summer Tour. In July 2016 Fitz and the Tantrums performed at Slossfest in Birmingham, Alabama. The band supported OneRepublic on the 2017 Honda Civic Tour which began on July 7, 2017.\n\nAll the Feels\nOn March 20, 2019, the band released the single \"123456\" from their fourth studio album. The second single, \"Don't Ever Let Em\", was released on April 17 of the same year, followed by \"I Need Help!\" on May 3, and then the title track of the album, \"All the Feels\" on June 28.\nThe album, All the Feels, consists of 17 songs and was released on September 20, 2019, through Elektra Records.\n\nLet Yourself Free\nOn June 10, 2022, the band released the single \"Sway\" through Elektra Records. This was followed by the single \"Moneymaker\" on September 27, 2022, along with the announcement of their fifth studio album Let Yourself Free, which was released on November 11, 2022.\n\nMusical style\nFitzpatrick has said that the band's musical style can be fairly described as \"soul-influenced indie pop.\" He said that while the band is influenced by the classic songs of the Motown and Stax record labels, the band is not trying to create an exact replica of that music. In another interview, Fitzpatrick talked about his decision not to use guitars in the band. \"I did want to try and make a big sounding record without guitars,\" he said. \"For me, I just feel like in any music that has a band, the guitar is always there, it's always featured, it's always prevalent. I'm just sick of hearing it.\"\n\nCritical reception\nLos Angeles Times music critic Ann Powers wrote, \"Fitz & the Tantrums is the kind of band that communicates best in concert, but this album serves as a fine proxy and party-starter.\" Aly Comingore of the Santa Barbara Independent wrote that the band members craft \"soulful, nostalgia pop that's not only infectious, but just fresh enough to make it stand apart from its predecessors.\" The band was heralded as a \"band to watch\" in an April 2011 profile in Rolling Stone. In June 2011, Vogue named Fitz and the Tantrums the \"Hardest-Working Band\" of the 2011 summer festival circuit. \"Not only do L.A.–based six-piece Fitz and the Tantrums share James Brown's penchant for snazzy-dressed brass bands and feel-good retro ballads, they also have the late godfather of soul's tireless work ethic.\" Their third album has been described as \"a product of contemporary market forces and a depressing relic of an era of the music industry best forgotten.\"\n\nBand members\nTimeline\nDiscography\nPickin' Up the Pieces (2010)\nMore Than Just a Dream (2013)\nFitz and the Tantrums (2016)\nAll the Feels (2019)\nLet Yourself Free (2022)\nPassage 2:\nBlood, Sweat &amp; 3 Years\nBlood, Sweat & 3 Years is the fourth studio album by American electronic music group Cash Cash, released on June 24, 2016 by Big Beat Records and Atlantic Records.

The album was produced by the group themselves and Digital Farm Animals. The album took 36 months to complete. Jean Paul Makhlouf spoke about the long process of finishing the album.\n\n\"The biggest thing that makes it hard for us to put out albums left and right is that we're not all home in one place for enough time. We play a lot of shows together, but most of the touring is done with me and Sam, and there's only so much that Alex or one of us can do back home in the studio. Sam can finish ideas that we started or he can keep things moving in a direction, but ultimately, we all need to be home in the studio to make a final product.\"\nThe title of the album comes from a representation of the last three years of the groups lives. Following the release of the album, the group embarked on a 2016 headlining tour called Must Be the Money Tour.\n\nSingles\n\"Take Me Home\", featuring guest vocals from singer Bebe Rexha, was released on July 15, 2013, originally from the band's 2013 EP Overtime. It was later included on Blood, Sweat & 3 Years as its first single. It reached number 57 on the Billboard Hot 100 selling 488,000 downloads, becoming their first (and, to date, only) charting single in the US. It also reached number 6 on the Dance/Electronic Songs chart. It also peaked within the top ten in Australia and the UK. The music video premiered on December 18, 2013. \"Lightning\", featuring guest vocals from Goo Goo Dolls frontman John Rzeznik, was released on March 24, 2014. It was originally from the band's 2014 EP Lightning, but was later included as the second single from Blood, Sweat & 3 Years. Unlike \"Take Me Home\", \"Lightning\" did not chart. The lyric video premiered on August 11, 2014. \"Surrender\", featuring uncredited guest vocals from singer and songwriter Julia Michaels, was released on September 16, 2014 as the third single from the album.

It reached number 28 on the Dance/Electronic songs chart, and number 110 in the UK. \"Escarole\" was released on December 11, 2015 as the album's fifth single.\"Aftershock\", featuring guest vocals from singer Jacquie Lee, was released on January 29, 2016 as the album's sixth single.

The music video was released on June 27, 2016. \"Broken Drum\", featuring guest vocals from Michael Fitzpatrick of Fitz and the Tantrums, was released on June 17, 2016 as the album's ninth single, accompanied by a music video.\n\nCritical reception\nAlexendra Blair from Dancing Astronaut wrote that Cash Cash have \"delivered a quality pop music release on which any song could be a confetti-drenched closer\" by praising their track production and the appearance of quality collaborators such as Christina Perri and  Michael Fitzpatrick of Fitz and the Tantrums. She then criticised Nelly's performance on \"Millionaire\" by describing it as a \"whitewashing of the rapper's sometimes gritty and often wryly wrought vocal style\" and felt that \"Devil\" was \"hollow with a sanitized inauthenticity\" despite strong verses from B.o.B and Busta Rhymes. AllMusic's Neil Z. Yeung gave the album a 4/5 rating and stated that it was a \"celebration of the many facets of dance in the 2010s EDM era, from trap to tropical and everything in between\". He complimented their \"impressive list of guests for the effort\" and said that the brightest moments of the record came courtesy of the female vocalists, who bring a \"carefree and breezy energy to balance the machismo\". Connor Jones from We Got This Covered felt like the album \"plays more like a loose collection of songs than a cohesive whole\", due to some tracks being released back in 2013 which causes them to feel mismatched when listened to. He continued by stating that the record feels repetitious and formulaic regarding its female led vocal collaborations, even with the presence of many excellent tracks. The critic concluded by writing that tracks like \"How To Love\" which \"strike the right balance between radio friendly pop and crowd pleasing dance rhythms\" works best in Blood, Sweat & 3 Years, and praised the \"crystal clear mixing\" and \"excellent synth work\" on the record.Daniel Patrin of Renowned For Sound granted the record a 2/5 rating and stated that it consisted of \"calculable, artificial pop music with forced momentum\", mimicking the works of Afrojack and Swedish House Mafia which made it lack \"any real aspects of individualism\".\n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks produced by Cash Cash, except \"Millionaire\" produced by Cash Cash and Digital Farm Animals.\n\nPersonnel\nCredits for Blood, Sweat & 3 Years adapted from AllMusic.\n\nCharts\nCertifications\nRelease history\nPassage 3:\nOut of My League\nOut of My League may refer to:\n\nOut of My League (song), a song recorded by American band Fitz and the Tantrums\nOut of My League (film), a 2020 Italian romantic comedy-drama film by Alice Filippi\nPassage 4:\nJames King (musician)\nJames King is an American multi-instrumentalist who is a co-founder for soul band Fitz and the Tantrums.

He started off by teaching himself how to play the trumpet going into his senior year of high school. He was accepted to California Institute of the Arts where he studied jazz.

His father, Robert Fitzpatrick, is Irish American and his mother, Sylvie, is French. He attended the L.A. County High School for the Arts, studying vocal music and then studied experimental film at the California Institute of the Arts, where he met fellow band member James King. Although he now composes primarily on the piano and organ, he only had formal piano training later in life. He has said, \"I'd always been a decent singer, but I got frustrated by my inability to play piano by anything more than by ear. I took piano lessons when I was 32, and it opened up a whole new vocabulary for me.\" Fitzpatrick grew up mostly listening to classical music, as he was discouraged from listening to other music styles in the household. One concession, however, was being allowed to listen to a local oldie radio station in the car driving to and from school.After college, he worked for many years behind the scenes as a sound engineer for producer Mickey Petralia, who produced Beck, Ladytron, Flight of the Conchords, and The Dandy Warhols.In late 2008, Fitzpatrick received a call from an ex-girlfriend to tell him about a neighbor who needed to unload or sell a church organ for $50. Fitzpatrick told her to pay the neighbor the $50 and arranged to have the organ moved to his apartment that same day. That evening, inspired by the organ, he wrote the song \"Breakin' the Chains of Love\". He has stated, \"I immediately knew it was the best song I'd written. I could astral plane out and hear myself, like, 'wow!' Not bad!\". Fitzpatrick decided to form a band, and contacted friend and saxophonist James King. Through phone calls they assembled the band, with King recommending singer Noelle Scaggs and drummer John Wicks, and Wicks in turn bringing in bassist Ethan Phillips and keyboardist Jeremy Ruzumna. The band met for its first rehearsal a week later and instantly clicked.\nIn interviews, he has emphasized his eclectic musical tastes. He has said, \"We [the band] all have a love affair with soul and funk music. For me, it's obviously Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, the Supremes, all that stuff. My musical taste runs the gamut from Radiohead to Zeppelin to Major Lazer. My older brother was really into '80s new wave, so a lot of the first records I got to borrow and steal were his.\"\n\nPersonal life\nIn May 2013, it was announced that Fitzpatrick was expecting a child with then-girlfriend actress Kaylee DeFer. DeFer gave birth to their son in September 2013. Fitzpatrick and DeFer married on 25 July 2015.

She acted as a backup singer in Be Cool with John Travolta.\n\nThe Rebirth\nScaggs soon joined as front-woman and songwriter for The Rebirth, a Los Angeles soul band. In 2005 The Rebirth released their first album This Journey In on independent label Kajmere Sound. She wrote the track \"Stray Away\" and a number of other songs on their LP, co-writing with band leader Carlos Guiaco.The first single, \"This Journey In\", hit the top 5 of playlists throughout Europe and Japan, and attracted the attention of DJs such as BBC Radio 1's Gilles Peterson, King Britt of the group Digable Planets, and Norman Jay MBE. Scaggs toured with the band for ten years before taking two years off from music.\n\nFitz and the Tantrums\nIn December 2008 she joined the Los Angeles soul/pop band Fitz and the Tantrums for a rehearsal after being recommended to band leader Michael Fitzpatrick by saxophone player James King. According to Scaggs, \"When I first heard the project I was really attracted to the sound. It was something that wasn't really familiar in the spectrum of not being exactly Motown or something from the '80s.\"They performed for the first time a week later at Hollywood's Hotel Café, and she decided to remain with the band as a vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. They released their debut EP Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1 in August 2009, and the tracks soon received airplay on public radio station KCRW in Los Angeles.\nSix months after their first performance they had slots at Lollapalooza and Telluride Blues & Brews. In late 2009 they toured with Hepcat, Flogging Molly, and opened eight concerts for Maroon 5. The band signed to Dangerbird Records in April 2010, and Scaggs has since appeared with the band on Jimmy Kimmel Live!,  Conan and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\nTheir first full-length album, Pickin' Up the Pieces was released on August 24, 2010. It received critical acclaim and reached No. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, 140 on the Billboard 200, and 18 on the Independent Albums chart.\nThey were called by Vogue Magazine the \"Hardest Working Band of 2011,\" and \"Artist to Watch\" in Rolling Stone. Also according to Rolling Stone, the band \"throws a sparkling pop gloss on a familiar Motown sound thanks in large part to the powerhouse vocals of sultry singer Noelle Scaggs.\"\n\nDiscography\nSingles\n2003: The Craft (featuring Dilated Peoples)\n2018: Great For You (featuring BRÅVES)\n\nThe Rebirth\nStudio albums2006: This Journey In (Vocals, composer)\n\nFitz and the Tantrums\nStudio albums2009: Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1 EP (Composer, vocals)\n2010: Santa Stole My Lady EP (Composer, vocals)\n2010: Pickin' Up the Pieces (Composer, vocals)\n2013: More Than Just A Dream (Composer, vocals, keyboards)\n2016: Fitz and the Tantrums ((Composer, vocals)\n2019: All the Feels (Composer, vocals)\n\nCollaborations\nStudio albums2000: The Rose That Grew from Concrete (Vocals)\n2000: Bridging the Gap by The Black Eyed Peas (Background vocals)\n2001: Expansion Team by Dilated Peoples (Vocals)\n2003: Elephunk by The Black Eyed Peas (Background vocals)\n2003: Must B 21: Soundtrack to Get Things Started by will.i.am (Background vocals)\n2004: Crescent Moon by Lunar Heights (Primary artist, vocals)\n2004: The Arrival by Cutthroat Dymond Cutz Family (Primary artist, vocals)\n2005: 100% Black Novenoe Volument DVD (Background vocals)\n2005: Grammy Nominees 2005 (Background vocals)\n2005: Push Comes to Shove by MED (Composer)\n2005: Monkey Business by The Black Eyed Peas (Background Vocals)\n2005: Soul Divas (Wagram) (Featured artist)\n2006: An Announcement to Answer by Quantic (Composer, primary artist, vocals)\n2006: Authentic Vintage by Jern Eye (Vocals)\n2007: Rough Guide to Latin Funk (Composer)\n2007: Shapes 07:01 (Composer)\n2007: Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (Musician, vocals)\n2007: The Killion Floor by Orgone (Lyricist, primary artist, vocals)\n2007: The Weatherman LP by Evidence (Choir, vocals)\n2007: Tropidelico by The Quantic Soul Orchestra (Primary artist, vocals)\n2008: Jungle Struttin' by The Lions (Vocals)\n2008: Ode to the Ghetto by Guilty Simpson (Vocals)\n2008: Out My Window by Koushik (Vocals)\n2008: The Layover EP by Evidence (Vocals)\n2009: The Connection, Vol. 1 by Evidence (Featured artist, vocals)\n2010: Distant Relatives by Damian \"Junior Gong\" Marley (Background vocals)\n2010: Fairfax Avenue by Roy Jay (Background vocals)\n2010: For What You've Lost by Raashan Ahmad (Featured artist)\n2011: Cats and Dogs by Evidence (Vocals)\n2011: How Do You Do by Mayer Hawthorne (Vocals)\n2011: Extra Playful by John Cale (Background vocals)\n\nSingles\n\"Let's Do It Again\"/\"Cherry Pie\" (Featured artist, composer)\n\nFilmography\n2005: Be Cool (Backup singer)\n2006: Where is Love Waiting (Singer)",
