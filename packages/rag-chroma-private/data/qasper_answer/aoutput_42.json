    "answer": "The models are evaluated by training an autocomplete system on 500K randomly sampled sentences from Yelp reviews. The efficiency of a communication scheme is quantified by the retention rate of tokens, which is the fraction of tokens kept in the keywords. The accuracy of the scheme is measured as the fraction of sentences generated by greedily decoding the model that exactly matches the target sentence. Additionally, 100 crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) were recruited to measure completion times and accuracies for typing randomly sampled sentences from the Yelp corpus. Each user was shown alternating autocomplete and writing tasks across 50 sentences."
