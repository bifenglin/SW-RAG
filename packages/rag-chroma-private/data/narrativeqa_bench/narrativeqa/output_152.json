Porch stretches almost completely across the stage, with a\nplank bench at either end. At the center of the porch three steps\nleading from street. Rear of porch, center, door to the store. On\neither side are single windows on which signs, at left, \"POST OFFICE\",\nand at right, \"GENERAL STORE\" are painted. Soap boxes, axe handles,\nsmall kegs, etc., on porch on which townspeople sit and lounge during\naction. Above the roof of the porch the \"false front\", or imitation\nsecond story of the shop is seen with large sign painted across it\n\"JOE CLARK'S GENERAL STORE\". Large kerosine street lamp on post at\nright in front of porch.\n\nSaturday afternoon and the villagers are gathered around the store.\nSeveral men sitting on boxes at edge of porch chewing sugar cane,\nspitting tobacco juice, arguing, some whittling, others eating\npeanuts. During the act the women all dressed up in starched dresses\nparade in and out of store. People buying groceries, kids playing in\nthe street, etc. General noise of conversation, laughter and children\nshouting. But when the curtain rises there is momentary lull for\ncane-chewing. At left of porch four men are playing cards on a soap\nbox, and seated on the edge of the porch at extreme right two children\nare engaged in a checker game, with the board on the floor between\nthem.\n\nWhen the curtain goes up the following characters are discovered on\nthe porch: MAYOR JOE CLARK, the storekeeper; DEACON HAMBO; DEACON\nGOODWIN; Old Man MATT BRAZZLE; WILL CODY; SYKES JONES; LUM BOGER, the\nyoung town marshall; LIGE MOSELY and WALTER THOMAS, two village wags;\nTOM NIXON and SAM MOSELY, and several others, seated on boxes, kegs,\nbenches and floor of the porch. TONY TAYLOR is sitting on steps of\nporch with empty basket. MRS. TAYLOR comes out with her arms full of\ngroceries, empties them into basket and goes back in store. All the\nmen are chewing sugar cane earnestly with varying facial expressions.\nThe noise of the breaking and sucking of cane can be clearly heard in\nthe silence. Occasionally the laughter and shouting of children is\nheard nearby off stage.\n\nHAMBO: (To BRAZZLE) Say, Matt, gimme a jint or two of dat green\ncane--dis ribbon cane is hard.\n\nLIGE: Yeah, and you ain't got de chears in yo' parlor you useter have.\n\nHAMBO: Dat's all right, Lige, but I betcha right now wid dese few\nteeth I got I kin eat up more cane'n you kin grow.\n\nLIGE: I know you kin and that's de reason I ain't going to tempt you.\nBut youse gettin' old in lots of ways--look at dat bald-head--just as\nclean as my hand. (Exposes his palm).\n\nHAMBO: Don't keer if it tis--I don't want nothin'--not even\nhair--between me and God. (General laughter--LIGE joins in as well.\nCane chewing keeps up. Silence for a moment.)\n\n(Off stage a high shrill voice can be heard calling:)\n\nVOICE: Sister Mosely, Oh, Sister Mosely! (A pause) Miz Mosely! (Very\nirritated) Oh, Sister Mattie! You hear me out here--you just won't\nanswer!\n\nVOICE OF MRS. MOSELY: Whoo-ee ... somebody calling me?\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (Angrily) Never mind now--you couldn't come\nwhen I called you. I don't want yo' lil ole weasley turnip greens.\n(Silence)\n\nMATT BRAZZLE: Sister Roberts is en town agin! If she was mine, I'll\nbe hen-fired if I wouldn't break her down in de lines (loins)--good as\ndat man is to her!\n\nHAMBO: I wish she was mine jes' one day--de first time she open her\nmouf to beg _anybody_, I'd lam her wid lightning.\n\nJOE CLARK: I God, Jake Roberts buys mo' rations out dis store than any\nman in dis town. I don't see to my Maker whut she do wid it all....\nHere she come....\n\n(ENTER MRS. JAKE ROBERTS, a heavy light brown woman with a basket on\nher arm. A boy about ten walks beside her carrying a small child about\na year old straddle of his back. Her skirts are sweeping the ground.\nShe walks up to the step, puts one foot upon the steps and looks\nforlornly at all the men, then fixes her look on JOE CLARK.)\n\nMRS. ROBERTS: Evenin', Brother Mayor.\n\nCLARK: Howdy do, Mrs. Roberts. How's yo' husband?\n\nMRS. ROBERTS: (Beginning her professional whine): He ain't much and I\nain't much and my chillun is poly. We ain't got 'nough to eat! Lawd,\nMr. Clark, gimme a lil piece of side meat to cook us a pot of greens.\n\nCLARK: Aw gwan, Sister Roberts. You got plenty bacon home. Last week\nJake bought....\n\nMRS. ROBERTS: (Frantically) Lawd, Mist' Clark, how long you think dat\nlil piece of meat last me an' my chillun? Lawd, me and my chillun is\n_hongry_! God knows, Jake don't fee-eed me!\n\n(MR. CLARK sits unmoved. MRS. ROBERTS advances upon him)\n\nMist' Clark!\n\nCLARK: I God, woman, don't keep on after me! Every time I look, youse\nround here beggin' for everything you see.\n\nLIGE: And whut she don't see she whoops for it just de same.\n\nMRS. ROBERTS: (In dramatic begging pose) Mist' Clark! Ain't you boin'\ndo nuthin' for me? And you see me and my poor chillun is starvin'....\n\nCLARK: (Exasperated rises) I God, woman, a man can't git no peace wid\nsomebody like you in town. (He goes angrily into the store followed by\nMRS. ROBERTS. The boy sits down on the edge of the porch sucking the\nbaby's thumb.)\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: A piece 'bout dis wide....\n\nVOICE OF CLARK: I God, naw! Yo' husband done bought you plenty meat,\nnohow.\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (In great anguish) Ow! Mist' Clark! Don't you\ncut dat lil tee-ninchy piece of meat for me and my chillun! (Sound of\nrunning feet inside the store.) I ain't a going to tetch it!\n\nVOICE OF CLARK: Well, don't touch it then. That's all you'll git outa\nme.\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (Calmer) Well, hand it chear den. Lawd, me and\nmy chillun is _so_ hongry.... Jake don't fee-eed me. (She re-enters by\ndoor of store with the slab of meat in her hand and an outraged look\non her face. She gazes all about her for sympathy.) Lawd, me and my\npoor chillun is _so_ hongry ... and some folks has _every_thing and\nthey's so _stingy_ and gripin'.... Lawd knows, Jake don't fee-eed me!\n(She exits right on this line followed by the boy with the baby on his\nback.)\n\n(All the men gaze behind her, then at each other and shake their\nheads.)\n\nHAMBO: Poor Jak.... I'm really sorry for dat man. If she was mine I'd\nbeat her till her ears hung down like a Georgy mule.\n\nWALTER THOMAS: I'd beat her till she smell like onions.\n\nLIGE: I'd romp on her till she slack like lime.\n\nNIXON: I'd stomp her till she rope like okra.\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (Off stage right) Lawd, Miz Lewis, you goin'\ngive me dat lil han'ful of greens for me and my chillun. Why dat ain't\na eye-full. I ought not to take 'em ... but me and my chillun is _so_\nhongry.... Some folks is so stingy and gripin'! Lawd knows, Tony don't\n_feed_ me!\n\n(The noise of cane-chewing is heard again. Enter JOE LINDSAY left with\na gun over his shoulder and the large leg bone of a mule in the other\nhand. He approaches the step wearily.)\n\nHAMBO: Well, did you git any partridges, Joe?\n\nJOE: (Resting his gun and seating himself) Nope, but I made de\nfeathers fly.\n\nHAMBO: I don't see no birds.\n\nJOE: Oh, the feathers flew off on de birds.\n\nLIGE: I don't see nothin' but dat bone. Look lak you done kilt a cow\nand et 'im raw out in de woods.\n\nJOE: Don't y'all know dat hock-bone?\n\nWALTER: How you reckon we gointer know every hock-bone in Orange\nCounty sight unseen?\n\nJOE: (Standing the bone up on the floor of the porch) Dis is a\nhock-bone of Brazzle's ole yaller mule.\n\n(General pleased interest. Everybody wants to touch it.)\n\nBRAZZLE: (Coming forward) Well, sir! (Takes bone in both hands and\nlooks up and down the length of it) If 'tain't my ole mule! This sho\nwas one hell of a mule, too. He'd fight every inch in front of de\nplow ... he'd turn over de mowing machine ... run away wid de\nwagon ... and you better not look like you wanter _ride_ 'im!\n\nLINDSAY: (Laughing) Yeah, I 'member seein' you comin' down de road\njust so ... (He limps wid one hand on his buttocks) one day.\n\nBRAZZLE: Dis mule was so evil he used to try to bite and kick when I'd\ngo in de stable to feed 'im.\n\nWALTER: He was too mean to git fat. He was so skinny you could do a\nweek's washing on his ribs for a washboard and hang 'em up on his\nhip-bones to dry.\n\nLIGE: I 'member one day, Brazzle, you sent yo' boy to Winter Park\nafter some groceries wid a basket. So here he went down de road ridin'\ndis mule wid dis basket on his arm.... Whut you reckon dat ole\ncontrary mule done when he got to dat crooked place in de road going\nround Park Lake? He turnt right round and went through de handle of\ndat basket ... wid de boy still up on his back. (General laughter)\n\nBRAZZLE: Yeah, he up and died one Sat'day just for spite ... but he\nwas too contrary to lay down on his side like a mule orter and die\ndecent. Naw, he made out to lay down on his narrer contracted back and\ndie wid his feets sticking straight up in de air just so. (He gets\ndown on his back and illustrates.) We drug him out to de swamp wid 'im\ndat way, didn't we, Hambo?\n\nJOE CLARK: I God, Brazzle, we all seen it. Didn't we all go to de\ndraggin' out? More folks went to yo' mule's draggin' out than went to\nlast school closing.... Bet there ain't been a thing right in\nmule-hell for four years.\n\nHAMBO: Been dat long since he been dead?\n\nCLARK: I God, yes. He died de week after I started to cutting' dat new\nground.\n\n(The bone is passing from hand to hand. At last a boy about twelve\ntakes it. He has just walked up and is proudly handling the bone when\na woman's voice is heard off stage right.)\n\nVOICE: Senator! Senator!! Oh, you Senator?\n\nBOY: (Turning displeased mutters) Aw, shux. (Loudly) Ma'm?\n\nVOICE: If you don't come here you better!\n\nSENATOR: Yes ma'am. (He drops bone on ground down stage and trots off\nfrowning.) Soon as we men git to doing something dese wimmen....\n(Exits, right.)\n\n(Enter TEET and BOOTSIE left, clean and primped in voile dresses just\nalike. They speak diffidently and enter store. The men admire them\ncasually.)\n\nLIGE: Them girls done turned out to be right good-looking.\n\nWALTER: Teet ain't as pretty now as she was a few years back. She used\nto be fat as a butter ball wid legs just like two whiskey-kegs. She's\ntoo skinny since she got her growth.\n\nCODY: Ain't none of 'em pretty as dat Miss Daisy. God! She's pretty as\na speckled pup.\n\nLIGE: But she was sho nuff ugly when she was little ... little ole\nhard black knot. She sho has changed since she been away up North. If\nshe ain't pretty now, there ain't a hound dog in Georgy.\n\n(Re-enter SENATOR BAILEY and stops on the steps. He addresses JOE\nCLARK.)\n\nSENATOR: Mist' Clark....\n\nHAMBO: (To Senator) Ain't you got no manners? We all didn't sleep wid\nyou last night.\n\nSENATOR: (Embarrassed) Good evening, everybody.\n\nALL THE MEN: Good evening, son, boy, Senator, etc.\n\nSENATOR: Mist' Clark, mama said is Daisy been here dis evenin'?\n\nJOE CLARK: Ain't laid my eyes on her. Ain't she working over in\nMaitland?\n\nSENATOR: Yessuh ... but she's off today and mama sent her down here to\nget de groceries.\n\nJOE CLARK: Well, tell yo' ma I ain't seen her.\n\nSENATOR: Well, she say to tell you when she come, to tell her ma say\nshe better git home and dat quick.\n\nJOE CLARK: I will. (Exit BOY right.)\n\nLIGE: Bet she's off somewhere wid Dave or Jim.\n\nWALTER: I don't bet it ... I know it. She's got them two in de\ngo-long.\n\n(Re-enter TEET and BOOTSIE from store. TEET has a letter and BOOTSIE\ntwo or three small parcels. The men look up with interest as they come\nout on the porch.)\n\nWALTER: (Winking) Whut's dat you got, Teet ... letter from Dave?\n\nTEET: (Flouncing) Naw indeed! It's a letter from my B-I-T-sweetie!\n(Rolls her eyes and hips.)\n\nWALTER: (Winking) Well, ain't Dave yo' B-I-T-sweetie? I thought y'all\nwas 'bout to git married. Everywhere I looked dis summer 'twas you and\nDave, Bootsie and Jim. I thought all of y'all would've done jumped\nover de broomstick by now.\n\nTEET: (Flourishing letter) Don't tell it to me ... tell it to the\never-loving Mr. Albert Johnson way over in Apopka.\n\nBOOTSIE: (Rolling her eyes) Oh, tell 'em 'bout the ever-loving Mr.\nJimmy Cox from Altamont. Oh, I can't stand to see my baby lose.\n\nHAMBO: It's lucky y'all girls done got some more fellers, cause look\nlike Daisy done treed both Jim and Dave at once, or they done treed\nhere one.\n\nTEET: Let her have 'em ... nobody don't keer. They don't handle de \"In\nGod we trust\" lak my Johnson. He's head bellman at de hotel.\n\nBOOTSIE: Mr. Cox got money's grandma and old grandpa change. (The\ngirls exit huffily.)\n\nLINDSAY: (To HAMBO, pseudo-seriously) You oughtn't tease dem gals lak\ndat.\n\nHAMBO: Oh, I laks to see gals all mad. But dem boys is crazy sho nuff.\nBefore Daisy come back here they both had a good-looking gal a piece.\nNow they 'bout to fall out and fight over half a gal a piece. Neither\none won't give over and let de other one have her.\n\nLIGE: And she ain't thinking too much 'bout no one man. (Looks off\nleft.) Here she come now. God! She got a mean walk on her!\n\nWALTER: Yeah, man. She handles a lot of traffic! Oh, mama, throw it in\nde river ... papa'll come git it!\n\nLINDSAY: Aw, shut up, you married men!\n\nLIGE: Man don't go blind cause he gits married, do he? (Enter DAISY\nhurriedly. Stops at step a moment. She is dressed in sheer organdie,\nwhite shoes and stockings.)\n\nDAISY: Good evening, everybody. (Walks up on the porch.)\n\nALL THE MEN: (Very pleasantly) Good evening, Miss Daisy.\n\nDAISY: (To CLARK) Mama sent me after some meal and flour and some\nbacon and sausage oil.\n\nCLARK: Senator been here long time ago hunting you.\n\nDAISY: (Frightened) Did he? Oo ... Mist' Clark, hurry up and fix it\nfor me. (She starts on in the store.)\n\nLINDSAY: (Giving her his seat) You better wait here, Daisy.\n\n(WALTER kicks LIGE to call his attention to LINDSAY'S attitude)\n\nIt's powerful hot in dat store. Lemme run fetch 'em out to you.\n\nLIGE: (To LINDSAY) _Run!_ Joe Lindsay, you ain't been able to run\nsince de big bell rung. Look at dat gray beard.\n\nLINDSAY: Thank God, I ain't gray all over. I'm just as good a man\nright now as any of you young 'uns. (He hurries on into the store.)\n\nWALTER: Daisy, where's yo' two body guards? It don't look natural to\nsee you thout nary one of 'em.\n\nDAISY: (Archly) I ain't got no body guards. I don't know what you\ntalkin' about.\n\nLIGE: Aw, don' try to come dat over us, Daisy. You know who we talkin'\n'bout all right ... but if you want me to come out flat footed ...\nwhere's Jim and Dave?\n\nDAISY: Ain't they playin' somewhere for de white folks?\n\nLIGE: (To WALTER) Will you listen at dis gal, Walter? (To DAISY) When\nI ain't been long seen you and Dave going down to de Lake.\n\nDAISY: (Frightened) Don't y'all run tell mama where I been.\n\nWALTER: Well, you tell us which one you laks de best and we'll wipe\nour mouf (Gesture) and say nothin'. Dem boys been de best of friends\nall they life, till both of 'em took after you ... then good-bye, Katy\nbar de door!\n\nDAISY: (Affected innocence) Ain't they still playin' and dancin'\ntogether?\n\nLIGE: Yeah, but that's 'bout all they do 'gree on these days. That's\nde way it is wid men, young and old.... I don't keer how long they\nbeen friends and how thick they been ... a woman kin come between 'em.\nDavid and Jonather never would have been friends so long if Jonather\nhad of been any great hand wid de wimmen. You ain't never seen no two\nroosters that likes one another.\n\nDAISY: I ain't tried to break 'em up.\n\nWALTER: Course you ain't. You don't have to. All two boys need to do\nis to git stuck on de same girl and they done broke up ... _right\nnow_! Wimmen is something can't be divided equal.\n\n(Re-enter JOE LINDSAY and CLARK with the groceries. DAISY jumps up and\ngrabs the packages.)\n\nLIGE: (To DAISY) Want some of us ... me ... to go long and tote yo'\nthings for you?\n\nDAISY: (Nervously) Naw, mama is riding her high horse today. Long as I\nbeen gone it wouldn't do for me to come walking up wid nobody. (She\nexits hurriedly right.)\n\n(All the men watch her out of sight in silence.)\n\nCLARK: (Sighing) I God, know whut Daisy puts me in de mind of?\n\nHAMBO: No, what? (They all lean together.)\n\nCLARK: I God, a great big mango ... a sweet smell, you know, Th a\nstrong flavor, but not something you could mash up like a strawberry.\nSomething with a body to it.\n\n(General laughter, but not obscene.)\n\nHAMBO: (Admiringly) Joe Clark! I didn't know you had it in you!\n\n(MRS. CLARK enters from store door and they all straighten up\nguiltily)\n\nCLARK: (Angrily to his wife) Now whut do you want? I God, the minute I\nset down, here you come....\n\nMRS. CLARK: Somebody want a stamp, Jody. You know you don't 'low me to\nbove wid de post office. (HE rises sullenly and goes inside the\nstore.)\n\nBRAZZLE: Say, Hambo, I didn't see you at our Sunday School picnic.\n\nHAMBO: (Slicing some plug-cut tobacco) Nope, wan't there dis time.\n\nWALTER: Looka here, Hambo. Y'all Baptist carry dis close-communion\nbusiness too far. If a person ain't half drownded in de lake and half\net up by alligators, y'all think he ain't baptized, so you can't take\ncommunion wid him. Now I reckon you can't even drink lemonade and eat\nchicken perlow wid us.\n\nHAMBO: My Lord, boy, youse just _full_ of words. Now, in de first\nplace, if this year's picnic was lak de one y'all had last year ...\nyou ain't had no lemonade for us Baptists to turn down. You had a big\nole barrel of rain water wid about a pound of sugar in it and one\nlemon cut up over de top of it.\n\nLIGE: Man, you sho kin mold 'em!\n\nWALTER: Well, I went to de Baptist picnic wid my mouf all set to eat\nchicken, when lo and behold y'all had chitlings! Do Jesus!\n\nLINDSAY: Hold on there a minute. There was plenty chicken at dat\npicnic, which I do know is right.\n\nWALTER: Only chicken I seen was half a chicken yo' pastor musta tried\nto swaller whole cause he was choked stiff as a board when I come\nlong ... wid de whole deacon's board beating him in de back, trying\nto knock it out his throat.\n\nLIGE: Say, dat puts me in de mind of a Baptist brother that was crazy\n'bout de preachers and de preacher was crazy 'bout feeding his face.\nSo his son got tired of trying to beat dese stump-knockers to de grub\non the table, so one day he throwed out some slams 'bout dese\npreachers. Dat made his old man mad, so he tole his son to git out.\nHe boy ast him \"Where must I go, papa?\" He says, \"Go on to hell I\nreckon ... I don't keer where you go.\"\n\nSo de boy left and was gone seven years. He come back one cold, windy\nnight and rapped on de door. \"Who dat?\" de old man ast him \"It's me,\nJack.\" De old man opened de door, so glad to see his son agin, and\ntole Jack to come in. He did and looked all round de place. Seven or\neight preachers was sitting round de fire eatin' and drinkin'.\n\n\"Where you been all dis time, Jack?\" de old man ast him.\n\n\"I been to hell,\" Jack tole him.\n\n\"Tell us how it is down there, Jack.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he says, \"It's just like it is here ... you cain't git to de\nfire for de preachers.\"\n\nHAMBO: Boy, you kin lie just like de cross-ties from Jacksonville to\nKey West. De presidin' elder must come round on his circuit teaching\ny'all how to tell 'em, cause you couldn't lie dat good just natural.\n\nWALTER: Can't nobody beat Baptist folks lying ... and I ain't never\nfound out how come you think youse so important.\n\nLINDSAY: Ain't we got de finest and de biggest church? Macedonia\nBaptist will hold more folks than any two buildings in town.\n\nLIGE: Thass right, y'all got a heap more church than you got members\nto go in it.\n\nHAMBO: Thass all right ... y'all ain't got neither de church nor de\nmembers. Everything that's had in this town got to be held in our\nchurch.\n\n(Re-enter JOE CLARK.)\n\nCLARK: What you-all talkin'?\n\nHAMBO: Come on out, Tush Hawg, lemme beat you some checkers. I'm tired\nof fending and proving wid dese boys ain't got no hair on they chest\nyet.\n\nCLARK: I God, you mean you gointer get beat. You can't handle me ...\nI'm a tush hawg.\n\nHAMBO: Well, I'm going to draw dem tushes right now. (To two small\nboys using checker board on edge of porch.) Here you chilluns, let de\nMayor and me have that board. Go on out an' play an' give us grown\nfolks a little peace. (The children go down stage and call out:)\n\nSMALL BOY: Hey, Senator. Hey, Marthy. Come on let's play chick-me,\nchick-me, cranie-crow.\n\nCHILD'S VOICE: (Off stage) All right! Come on, Jessie! (Enter several\nchildren, led by SENATOR, and a game begins in front of the store as\nJOE CLARK and HAMBO play checkers.)\n\nJOE CLARK: I God! Hambo, you can't play no checkers.\n\nHAMBO: (As they seat themselves at the check board) Aw, man, if you\nwasn't de Mayor I'd beat you all de time.\n\n(The children get louder and louder, drowning out the men's voices.)\n\nSMALL GIRL: I'm gointer be de hen.\n\nBOY: And I'm gointer be de hawk. Lemme git maself a stick to mark wid.\n\n(The boy who is the hawk squats center stage with a short twig in his\nhand. The largest girl lines up the other children behind her.)\n\nGIRL: (Mother Hen) (Looking back over her flock): Y'all ketch holt of\none 'Nother's clothes so de hawk can't git yuh. (They do.) You all\nstraight now?\n\nCHILDREN: Yeah. (The march around the hawk commences.)\n\nHEN AND CHICKS:\n  Chick mah chick mah craney crow\n  Went to de well to wash ma toe\n  When I come back ma chick was gone\n  What time, ole witch?\n\nHAWK: (Making a tally on the ground) One!\n\nHEN AND CHICKS: (Repeat song and march.)\n\nHAWK: (Scoring again) Two!\n\n(Can be repeated any number of times.)\n\nHAWK: Four. (He rises and imitates a hawk flying and trying to catch a\nchicken. Calling in a high voice:) Chickee.\n\nHEN: (Flapping wings to protect her young) My chickens sleep.\n\nHAWK: Chickee. (During all this the hawk is feinting and darting in\nhis efforts to catch a chicken, and the chickens are dancing\ndefensively, the hen trying to protect them.)\n\nHEN: My chicken's sleep.\n\nHAWK: I shall have a chick.\n\nHEN: You shan't have a chick.\n\nHAWK: I'm goin' home. (Flies off)\n\nHEN: Dere's de road.\n\nHAWK: My pot's a boilin'.\n\nHEN: Let it boil.\n\nHAWK: My guts a growlin'.\n\nHEN: Let 'em growl.\n\nHAWK: I must have a chick.\n\nHEN: You shan't have n'airn.\n\nHAWK: My mama's sick.\n\nHEN: Let her die.\n\nHAWK: Chickie!\n\nHEN: My chicken's sleep.\n\n(HAWK darts quickly around the hen and grabs a chicken and leads him\noff and places his captive on his knees at the store porch. After a\nbrief bit of dancing he catches another, then a third, etc.)\n\nHAMBO: (At the checker board, his voice rising above the noise of the\nplaying children, slapping his sides jubilantly) Ha! Ha! I got you\nnow. Go ahead on and move, Joe Clark ... jus' go ahead on and move.\n\nLOUNGERS: (Standing around two checker players) Ol' Deacon's got you\nnow.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Don't see how he can beat the Mayor like that.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Got him in the Louisville loop. (These remarks are\ndrowned by the laughter of the playing children directly in front of\nthe porch. MAYOR JOE CLARK disturbed in his concentration on the\ncheckers and peeved at being beaten suddenly turns toward the\nchildren, throwing up his hands.)\n\nCLARK: Get on 'way from here, you limbs of Satan, making all that\nracket so a man can't hear his ears. Go on, go on!\n\n(THE MAYOR looks about excitedly for the town marshall. Seeing him\nplaying cards on the other side of porch, he bellows:)\n\nLum Boger, whyn't you git these kids away from here! What kind of a\nmarshall is you? All this passle of young'uns around here under grown\npeople's feet, creatin' disorder in front of my store.\n\n(LUM BOGER puts his cards down lazily, comes down stage and scatters\nthe children away. One saucy little girl refuses to move.)\n\nLUM BOGER: Why'nt you go on away from here, Matilda? Didn't you hear\nme tell you-all to move?\n\nLITTLE MATILDA: (Defiantly) I ain't goin' nowhere. You ain't none of\nmy mama. (Jerking herself free from him as LUM touches her.) My mama\nin the store and she told me to wait out here. So take that, ol' Lum.\n\nLUM BOGER: You impudent little huzzy, you! You must smell yourself ...\nyouse so fresh.\n\nMATILDA: The wind musta changed and you smell your own top lip.\n\nLUM BOGER: Don't make me have to grab you and take you down a\nbuttonhole lower.\n\nMATILDA: (Switching her little head) Go ahead on and grab me. You sho\ncan't kill me, and if you kill me, you sho can't eat me. (She marches\ninto the store.)\n\nSENATOR: (Derisively from behind stump) Ol' dumb Lum! Hey! Hey!\n\n(LITTLE BOY at edge of stage thumbs his nose at the marshall.)\n\n(LUM lumbers after the small boy. Both exit.)\n\nHAMBO: (To CLARK who has been thinking all this while what move to\nmake) You ain't got but one move ... go ahead on and make it. What's\nde matter, Mayor?\n\nCLARK: (Moving his checker) Aw, here.\n\nHAMBO: (Triumphant) Now! Look at him, boys. I'm gonna laugh in notes.\n(Laughing to the scale and jumping a checker each time) Do, sol, fa,\nme, lo ... one! (Jumping another checker) La, sol, fa, me, do ... two!\n(Another jump.) Do sol, re, me, lo ... three! (Jumping a third.) Lo\nsol, fa, me, re ... four! (The crowd begins to roar with laughter. LUM\nBOGER returns, looking on. Children come drifting back again playing\nchick-me-chick-me-cranie crow.)\n\nVOICE: Oh, ha! Done got the ol' tush hog.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Thought you couldn't be beat, Brother Mayor?\n\nCLARK: (Peeved, gets up and goes into the store mumbling) Oh, I coulda\nbeat you if I didn't have this store on my mind. Saturday afternoon\nand I got work to do. Lum, ain't I told you to keep them kids from\nplayin' right in front of this store?\n\n(LUM makes a pass at the nearest half-grown boy. The kids dart around\nhim teasingly.)\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Eh, heh.... Hambo done run him on his store ... done\nrun the ol' coon in his hole.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: That ain't good politics, Hambo, beatin' the Mayor.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Well, Hambo, you don't got to be so hard at checkers,\ncome on let's see what you can do with de cards. Lum Boger there got\nhis hands full nursin' the chilluns.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: (At the table) We ain't playin' for money, nohow,\nDeacon. We just playin' a little Florida Flip.\n\nHAMBO: Ya all can't play no Florida Flip. When I was a sinner there\nwasn't a man in this state could beat me playin' that game. But I'm a\ndeacon in Macedonia Baptist now and I don't bother with the cards no\nmore.\n\nVOICE AT CARD TABLE: All right, then, come on here Tony (To man with\nbasket on steps.) let me catch your jack.\n\nTAYLOR: (Looking toward door) I don't reckon I got time. I guess my\nwife gonna get through buying out that store some time or other and\nwant to go home.\n\nOLD MAN: (On opposite side of porch from card game) I bet my wife\nwould know better than expect me to sit around and wait for her with a\nbasket. Whyn't you tell her to tote it on home herself?\n\nTAYLOR: (Sighing and shaking his head.) Eh, Lawd!\n\nVOICE AT CARD TABLE: Look like we can't get nobody to come into this\ngame. Seem like everybody's scared a us. Come on back here, Lum, and\ntake your hand. (LUM makes a final futile gesture at the children.)\n\nLUM: Ain't I tole you little haitians to stay away from here?\n\n(CHILDREN scatter teasingly only to return to their play in front of\nthe store later on. LUM comes up on the porch and re-joins the card\ngame. Just as he gets seated, MRS. CLARK comes to the door of the\nstore and calls him.)\n\nMRS. CLARK: (Drawlingly) Columbus!\n\nLUM: (Wearily) Ma'am?\n\nMRS. CLARK: De Mayor say for you to go round in de back yard and tie\nup old lady Jackson's mule what's trampin' aup all de tomatoes in my\ngarden.\n\nLUM: All right. (Leaving card game.) Wait till I come back, folkses.\n\nLIGE: Oh, hum! (Yawning and putting down the deck of cards) Lum's sho\na busy marshall. Say, ain't Dave and Jim been round here yet? I feel\nkinder like hearin' a little music 'bout now.\n\nBOY: Naw, they ain't been here today. You-all know they ain't so thick\nnohow as they was since Daisy Bailey come back and they started\nrunnin' after her.\n\nWOMAN: You mean since she started runnin' after them, the young hussy.\n\nMRS. CLARK: (In doorway) She don't mean 'em no good.\n\nWALTER: That's a shame, ain't it now? (Enter LUM from around back of\nstore. He jumps on the porch and takes his place at the card box.)\n\nLUM: (To the waiting players) All right, boys! Turn it on and let the\nbad luck happen.\n\nLIGE: My deal. (He begins shuffling the cards with an elaborate\nfan-shape movement.)\n\nVOICE AT TABLE: Look out there, Lige, you shuffling mighty lot. Don't\ncarry the cub to us.\n\nLIGE: Aw, we ain't gonna cheat you ... we gonna beat you. (He slams\ndown the cards for LUM BOGER to cut.) Wanta cut 'em?\n\nLUM: No, ain't no need of cutting a rabbit out when you can twist him\nout. Deal 'em. (LIGE deals out the cards.)\n\nCLARK'S VOICE: (Inside the store) You, Mattie! (MRS. CLARK, who has\nbeen standing in the DOE, quickly turns and goes inside.)\n\nLIGE: Y-e-e-e! Spades! (The game is started.)\n\nLUM: Didn't snatch that jack, did you?\n\nLIGE: Aw, no, ain't snatched no jack. Play.\n\nWALTER: (LUM'S partner) Well, here it is, partner. What you want me to\nplay for you?\n\nLUM: Play jus' like I'm in New York, partner. But we gotta try to\ncatch that jack.\n\nLIGE: (Threateningly) Stick out your hand and draw back a nub.\n\n(WALTER THOMAS plays.)\n\nWALTER: I'm playin' a diamond for you, partner.\n\nLUM: I done tole you you ain't got no partner.\n\nLIGE: Heh, Heh! Partner, we got 'em. Pull off wid your king. Dey got\nto play 'em. (When that trick is turned, triumphantly:) Didn't I tell\nyou, partner? (Stands on his feet and slams down with his ace\nviolently) Now, come up under this ace. Aw, hah, look at ol' low,\npartner. I knew I was gonna catch 'em. (When LUM plays) Ho, ho, there\ngoes the queen.... Now, the jack's a gentleman.... Now, I'm playin' my\nknots. (Everybody plays and the hand is ended.) Partner, high, low,\njack and the game and four.\n\nWALTER: Give me them cards. I believe you-all done give me the cub\nthat time. Look at me ... this is Booker T Washington dealing these\ncards. (Shuffles cards grandly and gives them to LIGE to cut.) Wanta\ncut 'em?\n\nLIGE: Yeah, cut 'em and shoot 'em. I'd cut behind my ma. (He cuts the\ncards.)\n\nWALTER: (Turning to player at left, FRANK, LIGE'S partner) What you\nsaying, Frank?\n\nFRANK: I'm beggin'. (LIGE is trying to peep at cards.)\n\nWALTER: (Turning to LIGE) Stop peepin' at them cards, Lige. (To FRANK)\nDid you say you was beggin' or standin'?\n\nFRANK: I'm beggin'.\n\nWALTER: Get up off your knees. Go ahead and tell 'em I sent you.\n\nFRANK: Well, that makes us four.\n\nWALTER: I don't care if you is. (Pulls a quarter out of his pocket and\nlays it down on the box.) Twenty-five cents says I know the best one.\nLet's go. (Everybody puts down a quarter.)\n\nFRANK: What you want me to play for you partner?\n\nLIGE: Play me a club. (The play goes around to dealer, WALTER, who\ngets up and takes the card off the top of the deck and slams it down\non the table.)\n\nWALTER: Get up ol' deuce of deamonds and gallop off with your load.\n(TO LUM) Partner, how many times you seen the deck?\n\nLUM: Two times.\n\nWALTER: Well, then I'm gonna pull off, partner. Watch this ol' queen.\n(Everyone plays) Ha! Ha! Wash day and no soap. (Takes the jack of\ndiamonds and sticks him up on his forehead. Stands up on his feet.)\nPartner, I'm dumping to you ... play your king. (When it comes to his\nplay LUM, too, stands up. The others get up and they, too, excitedly\nslam their cards down.) Now, come on in this kitchen and let me splice\nthat cabbage! (He slams down the ace of diamonds. Pats the jack on his\nfor head, sings:) Hey, hey, back up, jenny, get your load. (Talking)\nDump to that jack, boys, dump to it. High, low, jack and the game and\nfour. One to go. We're four wid you, boys.\n\nLIGE: Yeah, but you-all playin' catch-up.\n\nFRANK: Gimme them cards ... lemme deal some.\n\nLIGE: Frank, now you really got responsibility on you. They's got one\ngame on us.\n\nFRANK: Aw, man, I'm gonna deal 'em up a mess. This deal's in the White\nHouse. (He shuffles and puts the cards down for WALTER to cut.) Cut\n'em.\n\nWALTER: Nope, I never cut green timber. (FRANK deals and turns the\ncard up.)\n\nFRANK: Hearts, boys. (He turns up an ace.)\n\nLUM: Aw, you snatched that ace, nigger.\n\nWALTER: Yeah, they done carried the cub to us, partner.\n\nLIGE: Oh, he didn't do no such a thing. That ace was turned fair. We\njus' too hard for you ... we eats our dinner out a the blacksmith\nshop.\n\nWALTER: Aw, you all cheatin'. You know it wasn't fair.\n\nFRANK: Aw, shut up, you all jus' whoopin' and hollerin' for nothin'.\nTryin' to bully the game. (FRANK and LIGE rise and shake hands\ngrandly.)\n\nLIGE: Mr. Hoover, you sho is a noble president. We done stuck these\nniggers full of cobs. They done got scared to play us.\n\nLIGE (?) Scared to play you? Get back down to this table, let me\nspread my mess.\n\nLOUNGER: Yonder comes Elder Simms. You all better squat that rabbit.\nThey'll be having you all up in the church for playin' cards.\n\n(FRANK grabs up the cards and puts them in his pocket quickly.\nEverybody picks up the money and looks unconcerned as the preacher\nenters. Enter ELDER SIMMS with his two prim-looking little children by\nthe hand.)\n\nELDER SIMMS: How do, children. Right warm for this time in November,\nain't it?\n\nVOICE: Yes sir, Reverend, sho is. How's Sister Simms?\n\nSIMMS: She's feelin' kinda po'ly today. (Goes on in store with his\nchildren)\n\nVOICE: (Whispering loudly) Don't see how that great big ole powerful\nwoman could be sick. Look like she could go bear huntin' with her\nfist.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: She look jus' as good as you-all's Baptist pastor's\nwife. Pshaw, you ain't seen no big woman, nohow, man. I seen one once\nso big she went to whip her little boy and he run up under her belly\nand hid six months 'fore she could find him.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Well, I knowed a woman so little that she had to get up\non a soap box to look over a grain of sand.\n\n(REV. SIMMS comes out of store, each child behind him sucking a stick\nof candy.)\n\nSIMMS: (To his children) Run on home to your mother and don't get\ndirty on the way. (The two children start primly off down the street\nbut just out of sight one of them utters a loud cry.)\n\nSIMMS'S CHILD: (Off stage) Papa, papa. Nunkie's trying to lick my\ncandy.\n\nSIMMS: I told you to go on and leave them other children alone.\n\nVOICE ON PORCH: (Kidding) Lum, whyn't you tend to your business.\n\n(TOWN MARSHALL rises and shoos the children off again.)\n\nLUM: You all varmints leave them nice chillun alone.\n\nLIGE: (Continuing the lying on porch) Well, you all done seen so much,\nbut I bet you ain't never seen a snake as big as the one I saw when I\nwas a boy up in middle Georgia. He was so big couldn't hardly move his\nself. He laid in one spot so long he growed moss on him and everybody\nthought he was a log, till one day I set down on him and went to\nsleep, and when I woke up that snake done crawled to Florida. (Loud\nlaughter.)\n\nFRANK: (Seriously) Layin' all jokes aside though now, you all remember\nthat rattlesnake I killed last year was almost as big as that Georgia\nsnake.\n\nVOICE: How big, you say it was, Frank?\n\nFRANK: Maybe not quite as big as that, but jus' about fourteen feet.\n\nVOICE: (Derisively) Gimme that lyin' snake. That snake wasn't but four\nfoot long when you killed him last year and you done growed him ten\nfeet in a year.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Well, I don't know about that. Some of the snakes\naround here is powerful long. I went out in my front yard yesterday\nright after the rain and killed a great big ol' cottonmouth.\n\nSIMMS: This sho is a snake town. I certainly can't raise no chickens\nfor 'em. They kill my little biddies jus' as fast as they hatch out.\nAnd yes ... if I hadn't cut them weeds out of the street in front of\nmy parsonage, me or some of my folks woulda been snake-bit right at\nour front door. (To whole crowd) Whyn't you all cut down these weeds\nand clean up these streets?\n\nHAMBO: Well, the Mayor ain't said nothin' 'bout it.\n\nSIMMS: When the folks misbehaves in this town I think they oughta lock\n'em up in a jail and make 'em work their fine out on the streets, then\nthese weeds would be cut down.\n\nVOICE: How we gonna do that when we ain't got no jail?\n\nSIMMS: Well, you sho needs a jail ... you-all needs a whole lot of\nimprovements round this town. I ain't never pastored no town so\nway-back as this one here.\n\nCLARK: (Who has lately emerged from the store, fanning himself,\noverhears this last remark and bristles up) What's that you say 'bout\nthis town?\n\nSIMMS: I say we needs some improvements here in this town ... that's\nwhat.\n\nCLARK: (In a powerful voice) And what improvements you figgers we\nneeds?\n\nSIMMS: A whole heap. Now, for one thing we really does need a jail,\nMayor. We oughta stop runnin' these people out of town that\nmisbehaves, and lock 'em up. Others towns has jails, everytown I ever\npastored had a jail. Don't see how come we can't have one.\n\nCLARK: (Towering angrily above the preacher) Now, wait a minute,\nSimms. Don't you reckon the man who knows how to start a town knows\nhow to run it? I paid two hundred dollars out of this right hand for\nthis land and walked out here and started this town befo' you was\nborn. I ain't like some of you new niggers, come here when grapes'\nripe. I was here to cut new ground, and I been Mayor ever since.\n\nSIMMS: Well, there ain't no sense in no one man stayin' Mayor all the\ntime.\n\nCLARK: Well, it's my town and I can be mayor jus' as long as I want\nto. It was me that put this town on the map.\n\nSIMMS: What map you put it on, Joe Clark? I ain't seen it on no map.\n\nCLARK: (Indignant) I God! Listen here, Elder Simms. If you don't like\nthe way I run this town, just' take your flat feets right on out and\ngit yonder crost the woods. You ain't been here long enough to say\nnothin' nohow.\n\nHAMBO: (From a nail keg) Yeah, you Methodist niggers always telling\npeople how to run things.\n\nTAYLOR: (Practically unheard by the others) We do so know how to run\nthings, don't we? Ain't Brother Mayor a Methodist, and ain't the\nschool-teacher a ...? (His remarks are drowned out by the others.)\n\nSIMMS: No, we don't like the way you're runnin' things. Now looka\nhere, (Pointing at the Marshall) You got that lazy Lum Boger here for\nmarshall and he ain't old enough to be dry behind his ears yet ... and\nall these able-bodied means in this town! You won't 'low nobody else\nto run a store 'ceptin' you. And looka yonder (happening to notice the\nstreet light) only street lamp in town, you got in front of your\nplace. (Indignantly) We pay the taxes and you got the lamp.\n\nVILLAGER: Don't you-all fuss now. How come you two always yam-yamming\nat each other?\n\nCLARK: How come this fly-by-night Methodist preacher over here ...\nain't been here three months ... tries to stand up on my store porch\nand tries to tell me how to run my town? (MATTIE CLARK, the Mayor's\nwife, comes timidly to the door, wiping her hands on her apron.) Ain't\nno man gonna tell me how to run my town. I God, I 'lected myself in\nand I'm gonna run it. (Turns and sees wife standing in door.\nCommandingly.) I God, Mattie, git on back in there and wait on that\nstore!\n\nMATTIE: (Timidly) Jody, somebody else wantin' stamps.\n\nCLARK: I God, woman, what good is you? Gwan, git in. Look like between\nwomen and preachers a man can't have no peace. (Exit CLARK.)\n\nSIMMS: (Continuing his argument) Now, when I pastored in Jacksonville\nyou oughta see what kinda jails they got there....\n\nLOUNGER: White folks needs jails. We colored folks don't need no jail.\n\nANOTHER VILLAGER: Yes, we do, too. Elder Simms is right....\n\n(The argument becomes a hubbub of voices.)\n\nTAYLOR: (Putting down his basket) Now, I tell you a jail....\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: (Emerging from the store door, arms full of groceries,\nlooking at her husband) Yeah, and if you don't shut up and git these\nrations home I'm gonna be worse on you than a jail and six judges.\nPickup that basket and let's go. (TONY meekly picks up the basket and\nhe and his wife exit as the sound of an approaching guitar is heard\noff stage.)\n\n(Two carelessly dressed, happy-go-lucky fellows enter together. One is\nfingering a guitar without playing any particular tune, and the other\nhas his hat cocked over his eyes in a burlesque, dude-like manner.\nThere are casual greetings.)\n\nWALTER: Hey, there, bums, how's tricks?\n\nLIGE: What yo' sayin', boys?\n\nHAMBO: Good evenin' sons.\n\nLIGE: How did you-all make out this evenin', boys?\n\nJIM: Oh, them white folks at the party shelled out right well. Kept\nDave busy pickin' it up. How much did we make today, Dave?\n\nDAVE: (Striking his pocket) I don't know, boy, but feels right heavy\nhere. Kept me pickin' up money just like this.... (As JIM picks a few\ndance chords, Dave gives a dance imitation of how he picked up the\ncoins from the ground as the white folks threw them.) We count it\nafter while. Woulda divided up with you already if you hadn't left me\nwhen you seen Daisy comin' by. Let's sit down on the porch and rest\nnow.\n\nLIGE: She sho is lookin' stylish and pretty since she come back with\nher white folks from up North. Wearin' the swellest clothes. And that\ncoal-black hair of hers jus' won't quit.\n\nMATTIE CLARK: (In doorway) I don't see what the mens always hanging\nafter Daisy Taylor for.\n\nCLARK: (Turning around on the porch) I God, you back here again. Who's\ntendin' that store? (MATTIE disappears inside.)\n\nDAVE: Well, she always did look like new money to me when she was here\nbefore.\n\nJIM: Well, that's all you ever did get was a look.\n\nDAVE: That's all you know! I bet I get more than that now.\n\nJIM: You might git it but I'm the man to use it. I'm a bottom fish.\n\nDAVE: Aw, man. You musta been walking round here fast asleep when\nDaisy was in this county last. You ain't seen de go I had with her.\n\nJIM: No, I ain't seen it. Bet you didn't have no letter from her while\nshe been away.\n\nDAVE: Bet you didn't neither.\n\nJIM: Well, it's just cause she can't write. If she knew how to scratch\nwith a pencil I'd had a ton of 'em.\n\nDAVE: Shaw, man! I'd had a post office full of 'em.\n\nOLD WOMAN: You-all ought to be shame, carrying on over a brazen heifer\nlike Daisy Taylor. Jus' cause she's been up North and come back, I\nreckon you cutting de fool sho 'nough now. She ain't studying none of\nyou-all nohow. All she wants is what you got in your pocket.\n\nJIM: I likes her but she won't git nothin' outa me. She never did. I\nwouldn't give a poor consumpted cripple crab a crutch to cross the\nRiver Jurdon.\n\nDAVE: I know I ain't gonna give no woman nothin'. I wouldn't give a\ndog a doughnut if he treed a terrapin.\n\nLIGE: Youse a cottontail dispute ... both of you. You'd give her\nanything you got. You'd give her Georgia with a fence 'round it.\n\nOLD MAN: Yeah, and she'd take it, too.\n\nLINDSAY: Don't distriminate the woman like that. That ain't nothing\nbut hogism. Ain't nothin' the matter with Daisy, she's all right.\n\n(Enter TEETS and BOOTSIE tittering coyly and switching themselves.)\n\nBOOTSIE: Is you seen my mama?\n\nOLD WOMAN: You know you ain't lookin' for no mama. Jus' come back down\nhere to show your shape and fan around awhile. (BOOTSIE and TEETS\ngoing into the store.)\n\nBOOTSIE & TEETS: No, we ain't. We'se come to get our mail.\n\nOLD WOMAN: (After girls enter store) Why don't you all keep up some\nattention to these nice girls here, Bootsie and Teets. They wants to\nmarry.\n\nDAVE: Aw, who thinkin' 'bout marryin' now? They better stay home and\neat their own pa's rations. I gotta buy myself some shoes.\n\nJIM: The woman I'm gonna marry ain't born yet and her maw is dead.\n\n(GIRLS come out giggling and exit.) (JIM begins to strum his guitar\nlightly at first as the talk goes on.)\n\nCLARK: (To DAVE and JIM) Two of the finest gals that ever lived and\nfriendly jus' like you-all is. You two boys better take 'em back and\nstop them shiftless ways.\n\nHAMBO: Yeah, hurry up and do somethin'! I wants to taste a piece yo'\nweddin' cake.\n\nJIM: (Embarrassed but trying to be jocular) Whut you trying to rush\nme up so fast?... Look at Will Cody here (Pointing to little man on\nporch) he been promising to bring his already wife down for two\nmonths ... and nair one of us ain't seen her yet.\n\nDAVE: Yeah, how you speck me to haul in a brand new wife when he can't\nlead a wagon-broke wife eighteen miles? Me, I'm going git one soon's\nCody show me his'n. (General sly laughter at CODY'S expense.)\n\nWALTER: (Snaps his fingers and pretends to remember something) Thass\nright, Cody. I been intending to tell you.... I know where you kin buy\na ready-built house for you and yo' wife. (Calls into the store.) Hey,\nClark, cime on out here and tell Cody 'bout dat Bradley house. (To\nCODY.) I know you wants to git a place of yo' own so you kin settle\ndown.\n\nHAMBO: He done moved so much since he been here till every time he\nwalk out in his back yeard his chickens lay down and cross they legs.\n\nLINDSAY: Cody, I thought you tole us you was going up to Sanford to\nbring dat 'oman down here last Sat'day.\n\nLIGE: That ain't de way he tole me 'bout it. Look, fellers, (Getting\nup and putting one hand on his hips and one finger of the other hand\nagainst his chin coquettishly) Where you reckon I'll be next Sat'day\nnight?... Sittin' up side of Miz Cody. (Great burst of laughter.)\n\nSYKES JONES: (Laughing) Know what de folks tole me in Sanford? Dat was\nanother man's wife. (Guffaws.)\n\nCODY: (Feebly) Aw, you don't know whut you talkin' bout.\n\nJONES: Naw, I don't know, but de folks in Sanford does. (Laughing) Dey\ntell me when dat lady's husband come home Sat'day night, ole Cody\njumped out de window. De man grabbed his old repeater and run out in\nde yard to head him off. When Cody seen him come round de corner de\nhouse (Gesture) he flopped his wings and flew up on de fence. De man\nthowed dat shotgun dead on him. (Laughs) Den, man! Cody flopped his\nwings lak a buzzard (Gesture) and sailed on off. De man dropped to his\nknees lak dis (Gesture of kneeling on one knee and taking aim) Die!\ndie! die! (Supposedly sound of shots as the gun is moved in a circle\nfollowing the course of Cody's supposed flight) Cody just flew right\non off and lit on a hill two miles off. Then, man! (Gesture of swift\nflight) In ten minutes he was back here in Eatonville and in he bed.\n\nWALTER: I passed there and seen his house shakin', but I didn't know\nhow come.\n\nHAMBO: Aw, leave de boy alone.... If you don't look out some of y'all\ngoing to have to break his record.\n\nLIGE: I'm prepared to break it now. (General laughter.)\n\nJIM: Well, anyhow, I don't want to marry and leave Dave ... yet\nawhile. (Picking a chord.)\n\nDAVE: And I ain't gonna leave Jim. We been palling around together\never since we hollered titty mama, ain't we, boy?\n\nJIM: Sho is. (Music of the guitar increases in volume. DAVE shuffles a\nfew steps and the two begin to sing.)\n\nJIM:\n  Rabbit on the log.\n  I ain't got no dog.\n  How am I gonna git him?\n  God knows.\n\nDAVE:\n  Rabbit on the log.\n  Ain't got no dog.\n  Shoot him with my rifle\n  Bam! Bam!\n\n(Some of the villagers join in song and others get up and march around\nthe porch in time with the music. BOOTSIE and TEETS re-enter, TEETS\nsticking her letter down the neck of her blouse. JOE LINDSAY grabs\nTEETS and WALTER THOMAS grabs BOOTSIE. There is dancing, treating and\ngeneral jollification. Little children dance the parse-me-la. The\nmusic fills the air just as the sun begins to go down. Enter DAISY\nTAYLOR coming down the road toward the store.)\n\nCLARK: (Bawls out from the store porch) I God, there's Daisy again.\n\n(Most of the dancing stops, the music slows down and then stops\ncompletely. DAVE and JIM greet DAISY casually as she approaches the\nporch.)\n\nJIM: Well, Daisy, we knows you, too.\n\nDAVE: Gal, youse jus' as pretty as a speckled pup.\n\nDAISY: (Giggling) I see you two boys always playin' and singin'\ntogether. That music sounded right good floating down the road.\n\nJIM: Yeah, child, we'se been playin' for the white folks all week.\nWe'se playin' for the colored now.\n\nDAVE: (Showing off, twirling his dancing feet) Yeah, we're standin' on\nour abstract and livin' on our income.\n\nOLD MAN: Um-ump, but they ain't never workin'. Just round here playing\nas usual.\n\nJIM: Some folks think you ain't workin' lessen you smellin' a mule.\n(He sits back down on box and picks at his guitar.) Think you gotta\nbe beatin' a man to his barn every mornin'.\n\nVOICE: Glad to be round home with we-all again, ain't you Daisy?\n\nDAISY: Is I glad? I jus' got off special early this evenin' to come\nover here and see everybody. I was kinda 'fraid sundown would catch me\n'fore I got round that lake. Don't know how I'm gonna walk back to my\nworkin' place in the dark by muself.\n\nDAVE: Don't no girl as good-lookin' as you is have to go home by\nherself tonight.\n\nJIM: No, cause I'm here.\n\nDAVE: (To DAISY) Don't you trust yourself round that like wid all them\n'gators and moccasins with that nigger there, Daisy (Pointing at JIM)\nHe's jus' full of rabbit blood. What you need is a real man ... with\ngood feet. (Cutting a dance step.)\n\nDAISY: I ain't thinking 'bout goin' home yet. I'm goin' in the store.\n\nJIM: What you want in the store?\n\nDAISY: I want some gum.\n\nDAVE: (Starting toward door) Girl, you don't have to go in there to\ngit no gum. I'll go in there and buy you a carload of gum. What kind\nyou want?\n\nDAISY: Bubble gum. (DAVE goes in the store with his hand in his\npocket. The sun is setting and the twilight deepens.)\n\nJIM: (Pulling package out of his pocket and laughing) Here your gum,\nbaby. What it takes to please the ladies, I totes it. I don't have to\ngo get it, like Dave. What you gimme for it?\n\nDAISY: A bushel and a peck, and a hug around the neck. (She embraces\nJIM playfully. He hands her the gum, patting his shoulder as he sits\non box.) Oh, thank you. Youse a ready man.\n\nJIM: Yeah, there's a lot of good parts to me. You can have West Tampa\nif you want it.\n\nDAISY: You always was a nice quiet boy, Jim.\n\nDAVE: (Emerging from the store with a package of gum) Here's your gum,\nDaisy.\n\nJIM: Oh, youse late. She's done got gum now. Chaw that yourself.\n\nDAVE: (Slightly peeved and surprised) Hunh, you mighty fast here now\nwith Daisy but you wasn't that fast gettin' out of that white man's\nchicken house last week.\n\nJIM: Who you talkin' 'bout?\n\nDAVE: Hoo-oo? (Facetiously) You ain't no owl. Your feet don't fit no\nlimb.\n\nJIM: Aw, nigger, hush.\n\nDAVE: Aw, hush, yourself. (He walks away for a minute as DAISY turns\nto meet some newcomers. DAVE throws his package of gum down on the\nground. It breaks and several children scramble for the pieces. An old\nman, very drunk, carrying an empty jug enters on left and staggers\ntipsily across stage.) (MAYOR JOE CLARK emerges from the store and\nlooks about for his marshall.)\n\nCLARK: (Bellowing) Lum Boger!\n\nLUM BOGER: (Eating a stalk of cane) Yessir!\n\nCLARK: I God, Lum, take your lazy self off that keg and go light that\ntown lamp. All summer long you eatin' up my melon, and all winter long\nyou chawin' up my cane. What you think this town is payin' you for?\nLaying round here doin' nothin'? Can't you see it's gettin' dark?\n\n(LUM BOGER rises lazily and takes the soap box down stage, stands on\nit to light the lamp, discovers no oil in it and goes in store. In a\nfew moments he comes out of store, fills the lamp and lights it.)\n\nDAISY: (Coming back toward JIM) Ain't you all gonna play and sing a\nlittle somethin' for me? I ain't heard your all's music much for so\nlong.\n\nJIM: Play anything you want, Daisy. Don't make no difference what 'tis\nI can pick it. Where's that old coon, Dave? (Looking around for his\npartner.)\n\nLIGE: (Calling Dave, who is leaning against post at opposite end of\nporch) Come here, an' get warmed up for Daisy.\n\nDAVE: Aw, ma throat's tired.\n\nJIM: Leave the baby be.\n\nDAISY: Come on, sing a little, Dave.\n\nDAVE: (Going back toward Jim) Well, seeing who's asking ... all right.\nWhat song yo like, Daisy?\n\nDAISY: Um-m. Lemme think.\n\nVOICE ON PORCH: \"Got on the train, didn't have no fare\".\n\nDAISY: (Gaily) Yes, that one. That's a good one.\n\nJIM: (Begins to tune up. DAVE touches Daisy's hand.)\n\nVOICE: (In fun) Hunh, you all wouldn't play at the hall last week when\nwe asked you.\n\nVOICE OF SPITEFUL OLD WOMAN: Daisy wasn't here then.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: (Teasingly) All you got to do to some men is to shake a\nskirt tail in their face and they goes off their head.\n\nDAVE: (To JIM who is still tuning up) Come if you're comin' boy, let's\ngo if you gwine. (The full melody of the guitar comes out in a lively,\nold-fashioned tune.)\n\nVOICE: All right now, boys, do it for Daisy jus' as good as you do for\ndem white folks over in Maitland.\n\nDAVE & JIM: (Beginning to sing)\n  Got on the train,\n  Didn't have no fare,\n  But I rode some,\n  I rode some.\n  Got on the train,\n  Didn't have no fare,\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  Got on the train,\n  Didn't have no fare,\n  Conductor asked me what I'm doin' there,\n  But I rode some!\n\n  Grabbed me by the neck\n  And led me to the door.\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  Grabbed me by the neck\n  And led me to the door.\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  Grabbed me by the neck,\n  And led me to the door.\n  Rapped me cross the head with a forty-four,\n  But I rode some.\n\n  First thing I saw in jail\n  Was a pot of peas.\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  First thing I saw in jail\n  Was a pot of peas.\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  The peas was good,\n  The meat was fat,\n  Fell in love with the chain gang jus' for that,\n  But I rode some.\n\n(DAVE acts out the song in dancing pantomime and when it ends there\nare shouts and general exclamations of approval from the crowd.)\n\nVOICES: I don't blame them white folks for goin' crazy 'bout that....\n\nOLD MAN: Oh, when I was a young boy I used to swing the gals round on\nthat piece.\n\nDAISY: (TO JIM) Seem like your playin' gits better and better.\n\nDAVE: (Quickly) And how 'bout my singin'? (Everybody laughs.)\n\nVOICES IN THE CROWD: Ha! Ha! Ol' Dave's gittin' jealous when she\nspeaks o' Jim.\n\nJIM: (To DAVE, in fun) Ain't nothin' to it but my playin'. You ain't\ngot no singin' voice. If that's singin', God's a gopher.\n\nDAVE: (Half-seriously) My singin' is a whole lot better'n your\nplayin'. You jus' go along and fram. The reason why the white folks\ngives us money is cause I'm singin'.\n\nJIM: Yeah?\n\nDAVE: And you can't dance.\n\nVOICE IN THE CROWD: You oughta dance. Big as your feet is, Dave.\n\nDAISY: (Diplomatically) Both of you all is wonderful and I would like\nto see Dave dance a little.\n\nDAVE: There now, I told you. What did I tell you. (To JIM) Stop\nwoofing and pick a little tune there so that I can show Daisy\nsomethin'.\n\nJIM: Pick a tune? I bet if you fool with me I'll pick your bones jus'\nlike a buzzard did the rabbit. You can't sing and now you wants to\ndance.\n\nDAVE: Yeah, and I'll lam your head. Come on and play,\ngood-for-nothing.\n\nJIM: All right, then. You say you can dance ... show these people what\nyou can do. But don't bring that little stuff I been seein' you doin'\nall these years. (JIM plays and DAVE dances, various members of the\ncrowd keep time with their hands and feet, DAISY looks on enjoying\nherself immensely.)\n\nDAISY: (As DAVE cuts a very fancy step) I ain't seen nothin' like this\nup North. Dave you sho hot.\n\n(As DAVE cuts a more complicated step the crowd applauds, but just as\nthe show begins to get good, suddenly JIM stops playing.)\n\nDAVE: (Surprised) What's the matter, buddy?\n\nJIM: (Envious of the attention DAVE has been getting from DAISY,\ndisgustedly) Oh, nigger, I'm tired of seein' you cut the fool. 'Sides\nthat, I been playin' all afternoon for the white folks.\n\nDAISY: But I though you was playin' for me now, Jim.\n\nJIM: Yeah, I'd play all night long for you, but I'm gettin' sick of\nDave round here showin' off. Let him git somethin' and play for\nhimself if he can. (An OLD MAN with a lighted lantern enters.)\n\nDAISY: (Coyly) Well, honey, play some more for me, then, and don't\nmind Dave. I reckon he done danced enough. Play me \"Shake That\nThing\".\n\nOLD MAN WITH LANTERN: Sho, you ain't stopped, is you, boy? Music sound\nmighty good floatin' down that dark road.\n\nOLD WOMAN: Yeah, Jim, go on play a little more. Don't get to acting so\nniggerish this evening.\n\nDAVE: Aw, let the ol' darky alone. Nobody don't want to hear him play,\nnohow. I know I don't.\n\nJIM: Well, I'm gonna play. (And he begins to pick \"Shake That Thing\".\nTEETS and BOOTSIE begin to dance with LIGE MOSELY and FRANK WARRICK.\nAs the tune gets good, DAVE cannot resist the music either.)\n\nDAVE: Old nigger's eveil but he sho can play. (He begins to do a few\nsteps by himself, then twirls around in front of DAISY and approaches\nher. DAISY, overcome by the music, begins to step rhythmically toward\nDAVE and together they dance unobserved by JIM, absorbed in picking\nhis guitar.)\n\nDAISY: Look here, baby, at this new step I learned up North.\n\nDAVE: You can show me anything, sugar lump.\n\nDAISY: Hold me tight now. (But just as they begin the new movement JIM\nnotices DAISY and DAVE. He stops playing again and lays his guitar\ndown.)\n\nVOICES IN THE CROWD: (Disgustedly) Aw, come on, Jim.... You must be\njealous....\n\nJIM: No, I ain't jealous. I jus' get tired of seein' that ol' nigger\nclownin' all the time.\n\nDAVE: (Laughing and pointing to JIM on porch) Look at that mad baby.\nTake that lip up off the ground. Got your mouth stuck out jus' because\nsome one is enjoying themselves. (He comes up and pushes JIM\nplayfully.)\n\nJIM: You better go head and let me alone. (TO DAISY) Come here,\nDaisy!\n\nLIGE: That's just what I say. Niggers can't have no fun without\nsomeone getting mad ... specially over a woman.\n\nJIM: I ain't mad.... Daisy, 'scuse me, honey, but that fool, Dave....\n\nDAVE: I ain't mad neither.... Jim always tryin' to throw off on me.\nBut you can't joke him.\n\nDAISY: (Soothingly) Aw, now, now!\n\nJIM: You ain't jokin'. You means that, nigger. And if you tryin' to\nget hot, first thing, you can pull of my blue shirt you put on this\nmorning.\n\nDAVE: Youse a got that wrong. I ain't got on no shirt of yours.\n\nJIM: Yes, you is got on my shirt, too. Don't tell me you ain't got on\nmy shirt.\n\nDAVE: Well, even if I is, you can just lift your big plantations out\nof my shoes. You can just foot it home barefooted.\n\nJIM: You try to take any shoes offa me!\n\nLIGE: (Pacifying them) Aw, there ain't no use of all that. What you\nall want to start this quarreling for over a little jokin'.\n\nJIM: Nobody's quarreling.... I'm just playin' a little for Daisy and\nDave's out there clownin' with her.\n\nCLARK: (In doorway) I ain't gonna have no fussin' round my store, no\nway. Shut up, you all.\n\nJIM: Well, Mayor Clark, I ain't mad with him. We'se been friends all\nour lives. He's slept in my bed and wore my clothes and et my grub....\n\nDAVE: I et your grub? And many time as you done laid down with your\nbelly full of my grandma's collard greens. You done et my meat and\nbread a whole lot more times than I et your stewed fish-heads.\n\nJIM: I'd rather eat stewed fish-heads than steal out of other folkses\nhouses so much till you went to sleep on the roost and fell down one\nnight and broke up the settin' hen. (Loud laughter from the crowd)\n\nDAVE: Youse a liar if you say I stole anybody's chickens. I didn't\nhave to. But you ... 'fore you started goin' around with me, playin'\nthat little box of yours, you was so hungry you had the white mouth.\nIf it wasn't for these white folks throwin' _me_ money for _my_\ndancin', you would be thin as a whisper right now.\n\nJIM: (Laughing sarcastically) Your dancin'! You been leapin' around\nhere like a tailless monkey in a wash pot for a long time and nobody\nwas payin' no 'tention to you, till I come along playing.\n\nLINDSAY: Boys, boys, that ain't no way for friends to carry on.\n\nDAISY: Well, if you all gonna keep up this quarrelin' and carryin' on\nI'm goin' home. 'Bout time for me to be gittin' back to my white folks\nanyhow. It's dark now. I'm goin', even if I have to go by myself. I\nshouldn't a stopped by here nohow.\n\nJIM: (Stopping his quarrel) You ain't gonna go home by yourself. I'm\ngoin' with you.\n\nDAVE: (Singing softly)\n  It may be so,\n  I don't know.\n  But it sounds to me\n  Like a lie.\n\nWALTER: Dave ain't' got as much rabbit blood as folks thought.\n\nDAVE: Tell 'em 'bout me. (Turns to DAISY) Won't you choose a treat on\nme, Miss Daisy, 'fore we go?\n\nDAISY: (Coyly) Yessir, thank you. I wants a drink of soda water.\n\n(DAVE pulls his hat down over his eyes, whirls around and offers his\narm to DAISY. They strut into the store, DAVE gazing contemptuously at\nJIM as he passes. Crowd roars with laughter, much to the embarrassment\nof JIM.)\n\nLIGE: Ol' fast Dave jus' runnin' the hog right over you, Jim.\n\nWALTER: Thought you was such a hot man.\n\nLUM BOGER: Want me to go in there and put Daisy under arrest and bring\nher to you?\n\nJIM: (Sitting down on the edge of porch with one foot on the step and\nlights a cigarette pretending not to be bothered.) Aw, I'll get her\nwhen I want her. Let him treat her, but see who struts around that\nlake and down the railroad with her by and by.\n\n(DAVE and DAISY emerge from the store, each holding a bottle of red\nsoda pop and laughing together. As they start down the steps DAVE\naccidentally steps on JIM's outstretched foot. JIM jumps up and pushes\nDAVE back, causing him to spill the red soda all over his white shirt\nfront.)\n\nJIM: Stay off my foot, you big ox.\n\nDAVE: Well, you don't have to wet me all up, do you, and me in\ncompany? Why don't you put your damn foot in your pocket?\n\nDAISY: (Wiping DAVE'S shirt front with her handkerchief) Aw, ain't\nthat too bad.\n\nJIM: (To DAVE) Well, who's shirt did I wet? It's mine, anyhow, ain't\nit?\n\nDAVE: (Belligerently) Well, if it's your shirt, then you come take it\noff me. I'm tired of your lip.\n\nJIM: Well, I will.\n\nDAVE: Well, put your fist where you lip is. (Pushing DAISY aside.)\n\nDAISY: (Frightened) I want to go home. Now, don't you all boys fight.\n\n(JIM attempts to come up the steps. DAVE pushes him back and he\nstumbles and falls in the dust. General excitement as the crowd senses\na fight.)\n\nLITTLE BOY: (On the edge of crowd) Fight, fight, you're no kin. Kill\none another, won't be no sin. Fight, fight, you're no kin.\n\n(JIM jumps up and rushes for DAVE as the latter starts down the steps.\nDAVE meets him with his fist squarely in the face and causes him to\nstep backward, confused.)\n\nDAISY: (Still on porch, half crying) Aw, my Lawd! I want to go home.\n\n(General hubbub, women's cries of \"Don't let 'em fight.\" \"Why don't\nsomebody stop 'em?\" \"What kind of men is you all, sit there and let\nthem boys fight like that.\" Men's voices urging the fight: \"Aw, let\n'em fight.\" \"Go for him, Dave.\" \"Slug him, Jim.\"\n\nJIM makes another rush toward the steps. He staggers DAVE. DAVE knocks\nJIM sprawling once more. This time JIM grabs the mule bone as he\nrises, rushes DAVE, strikes DAVE over the head with it and knocks him\nout. DAVE falls prone on his back. There is great excitement.)\n\nOLD WOMAN: (Screams) Lawdy, is he kilt? (Several men rush to the\nfallen man.)\n\nVOICE: Run down to the pump and get a dipper o' water.\n\nCLARK: (To his wife in door) Mattie, come out of that store with a\nbottle of witch hazely oil quick as you can. Jim Weston, I'm gonna\narrest you for this. You Lum Boger. Where is that marshall? Lum Boger!\n(LUM BOGER detaches himself from the crowd.) Arrest Jim.\n\nLUM: (Grabs JIM'S arm, relieves him of the mule bone and looks\nhelplessly at the Mayor.) Now I got him arrested, what's I going to do\nwith him?\n\nCLARK: Lock him up back yonder in my barn till Monday when we'll have\nthe trial in de Baptist Church.\n\nLINDSAY: Yeah, just like all the rest of them Methodists ... always\ntryin' to take undercurrents on people.\n\nWALTER: Ain't no worse then some of you Baptists, nohow. You all don't\nrun this town. We got jus' as much to say as you have.\n\nCLARK: (Angrily to both men) Shut up! Done had enough arguing in front\nof my place. (To LUM BOGER) Take that boy on and lock him up in my\nbarn. And save that mule bone for evidence.\n\n(LUM BOGER leads JIM off toward the back of the store. A crowd follows\nhim. Other men and women are busy applying restoratives to DAVE. DAISY\nstands alone, unnoticed in the center of the stage.)\n\nDAISY: (Worriedly) Now, who's gonna take me home?\n\n\n:::: CURTAIN::::\n\n\n\n\nACT TWO\n\n\nSCENE I\n\nSETTING: Village street scene; huge oak tree upstage center; a house\nor two on back drop. When curtain goes up, Sister LUCY TAYLOR is seen\nstanding under the tree. She is painfully spelling it out.\n\n(Enter SISTER THOMAS, a younger woman (In her thirties) at left.)\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Evenin', Sis Taylor.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Evenin'. (Returns to the notice)\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Whut you doin'? Readin' dat notice Joe Clark put up\n'bout de meeting? (Approaches tree)\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Is dat whut it says? I ain't much on readin' since I\nhad my teeth pulled out. You know if you pull out dem eye teeth you\nruins' yo' eye sight. (Turns back to notice) Whut it say?\n\nSISTER THOMAS: (Reading notice) \"The trial of Jim Weston for assault\nand battery on Dave Carter wid a dangerous weapon will be held at\nMacedonia Baptist Church on Monday, November 10, at three o'clock. All\nare welcome. By order of J. Clark, Mayor of Eatonville, Florida.\"\n(Turning to SISTER TAYLOR) Hit's makin' on to three now.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: You mean it's right _now_. (Looks up at sun to tell\ntime) Lemme go git ready to be at de trial 'cause I'm sho goin' to be\nthere an' I ain't goin' to bite my tongue neither.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: I done went an' crapped a mess of collard greens for\nsupper. I better go put 'em on 'cause Lawd knows when we goin' to git\nouta there an' my husband is one of them dat's gointer eat don't keer\nwhut happen. I bet if judgment day was to happen tomorrow he'd speck I\norter fix him a bucket to carry long. (She moves to exit, right)\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: All men favors they guts, chile. But what you think of\nall dis mess they got goin' on round here?\n\nSISTER THOMAS: I just think it's a sin an' a shame befo' de livin'\njustice de way dese Baptis' niggers is runnin' round here carryin' on.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Oh, they been puttin' out the brags ever since Sat'day\nnight 'bout whut they gointer do to Jim. They thinks they runs this\ntown. They tell me Rev. CHILDERS preached a sermon on it yistiddy.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Lawd help us! He can't preach an' he look like 10 cents\nworth of have-mercy let lone gittin' up dere tryin' to throw slams at\nus. Now all Elder Simms done wuz to explain to us our rights ... whut\nyou think 'bout Joe Clarke runnin' round here takin' up for these ole\nBaptist niggers?\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: De puzzle-gut rascal ... we oughter have him up in\nconference an' put him out de Methdis' faith. He don't b'long in\nthere--wanter tun dat boy outa town for nothin'.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: But we all know how come he so hot to law Jim outa\ntown--hit's to dig de foundation out from under Elder Simms.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Whut he wants do dat for?\n\nSISTER THOMAS: 'Cause he wants to be a God-know-it-all an' a\nGod-do-it-all an' Simms is de onliest one in this town whut will buck\nup to him.\n\n(Enter SISTER JONES, walking leisurely)\n\nSISTER JONES: Hello, Hoyt, hello, Lucy.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Goin' to de meetin'?\n\nSISTER JONES: Done got my clothes on de line an' I'm bound to be dere.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Gointer testify for Jim?\n\nSISTER JONES: Naw, I reckon--don't make such difference to me which\nway de drop fall.... 'Tain't neither one of 'em much good.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: I know it. I know it, Ida. But dat ain't de point. De\ncrow we wants to pick is: Is we gointer set still an' let dese Baptist\ntell us when to plant an' when to pluck up?\n\nSISTER JONES: Dat is something to think about when you come to think\n'bout it. (Starts to move on) Guess I better go ahead--see y'all later\nan tell you straighter.\n\n(Enter ELDER SIMMS, right, walking fast, Bible under his arm, almost\ncollides with SISTER JONES as she exits.)\n\nSIMMS: Oh, 'scuse me, Sister Jones. (She nods and smiles and exits.)\nHow you do, Sister Taylor, Sister Thomas.\n\nBOTH: Good evenin', Elder.\n\nSIMMS: Sho is a hot day.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Yeah, de bear is walkin' de earth lak a natural man.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Reverend, look like you headed de wrong way.

I wants a chance to talk wid him a minute before court sets.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Y'think he'll come clear?\n\nSIMMS: (Proudly) I _know_ it! (Shakes the Bible) I'm goin' to law 'em\nfrom Genesis to Revelation.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Give it to 'em, Elder. Wear 'em out!\n\nSIMMS: We'se liable to havea new Mayor when all dis dust settle. Well,\nI better scuffle on down de road. (Exits, left.)\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Lord, lemme gwan home an' put dese greens on. (Looks\noff stage left) Here come Mayor Clark now, wid his belly settin' out\nin front of him like a cow catcher! His name oughter be Mayor Belly.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: (Arms akimbo) Jus' look at him! Tryin' to look like a\njigadier Breneral.\n\n(Enter CLARK hot and perspiring. They look at him coldly.)\n\nCLARK: I God, de bear got me! (Silence for a moment) How y'all\nfeelin', ladies?\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Brother Mayor, I ain't one of these folks dat bite my\ntongue an' bust my gall--whut's inside got to come out!

I\nain't sayin' Jim got 'em, but different people has tole me he burries\na powerful lot of feathers in his back yard. I God, I'm a ruint man!\n(He starts towards the right exit, but LUM BOGER enters right.) I God,\nLum, I been lookin' for you all day. It's almost three o'clock. (Hands\nhim a key from his ring) Take dis key an' go fetch Jim Weston on to de\nchurch.\n\nLUM: Have you got yo' gavel from de lodge-room?\n\nCLARK: I God, that's right, Lum. I'll go get it from de lodge room\nwhilst you go git de bone an' de prisoner. Hurry up! You walk like\ndead lice droppin' off you. (He exits right while LUM crosses stage\ntowards left.)\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Lum, Elder Simms been huntin' you--he's gone on down\n'bout de barn. (She gestures)\n\nLUM BOGER: I reckon I'll overtake him. (Exit left.)\n\nSISTER THOMAS: I better go put dese greens on. My husband will kill me\nif he don't find no supper ready. Here come Mrs. Blunt. She oughter\nfeel like a penny's worth of have-mercy wid all dis stink behind her\ndaughter.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Chile, some folks don't keer. They don't raise they\nchillun; they drags 'em up. God knows if dat Daisy wuz mine, I'd throw\nher down an' put a hundred lashes on her back wid a plow-line. Here\nshe come in de store Sat'day night (Acts coy and coquettish,\nburlesques DAISY'S walk) a wringing and a twisting!\n\n(Enter MRS. BLUNT, left.)\n\nMRS. BLUNT: How y'all sisters?\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Very well, Miz Blunt, how you?\n\nMRS. BLUNT: Oh, so-so.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: I'm kickin', but not high.\n\nMRS. BLUNT: Well, thank God you still on prayin' ground an' in a Bible\ncountry. Me, I ain't so many today. De niggers got my Daisy's name all\nmixed up in dis mess.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: You musn't mind dat, Sister Blunt. People jus' _will_\ntalk. They's talkin' in New York an' they's talkin' in Georgy an'\nthey's talkin' in Italy.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Chile, if you talk folkses talk, they'll have you in de\ngraveyard or in Chattahoochee one. You can't pay no 'tention to talk.\n\nMRS. BLUNT: Well, I know one thing. De man or women, chick or child,\ngrizzly or gray, that tells me to my face anything wrong 'bout _my_\nchile, I'm goin' to take _my_ fist (Rolls up right sleeve and gestures\nwith right fist) and knock they teeth down they throat. (She looks\nferocious) 'Case y'all know I raised my Daisy right round my feet till\nI let her go up north last year wid them white folks. I'd ruther her\nto be in de white folks' kitchen than walkin' de streets like some of\ndese girls round here. If I do say so, I done raised a lady. She can't\nhelp it if all dese mens get stuck on her.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: You'se tellin' de truth, Sister Blunt. That's whut I\nalways say: Don't confidence dese niggers. Do, they'll sho put you in\nde street.\n\nMRS. THOMAS: Naw indeed, never syndicate wid niggers. Do, they will\ndistriminate you. They'll be an _anybody_. You goin' to de trial,\nain't you?\n\nMRS. BLUNT: Just as sho as you snore. An' they better leave Daisy's\nname outa dis, too. I done told her and told her to come straight home\nfrom her work. Naw, she had to stop by dat store and skin her gums\nback wid dem trashy niggers. She better not leave them white folks\ntoday to come traipsin' over here scornin' her name all up wid dis\nnigger mess. Do, I'll kill her. No daughter of mine ain't goin' to do\nas she please, long as she live under de sound of my voice. (She\ncrosses to right.)\n\nMRS. THOMAS: That's right, Sister Blunt. I glory in yo' spunk. Lord, I\nbetter go put on my supper.\n\n(As MRS. BLUNT exits, right, REV. CHILDERS enters left with DAVE and\nDEACON LINDSAY and SISTER LEWIS. Very hostile glances from SISTERS\nTHOMAS and TAYLOR toward the others.)\n\nCHILDERS: Good evenin', folks.\n\n(SISTERS THOMAS and TAYLOR just grunt. MRS. THOMAS moves a step or two\ntowards exit. Flirts her skirts and exits.)\n\nLINDSAY: (Angrily) Whut's de matter, y'all? Cat got yo' tongue?\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: More matter than you kin scatter all over Cincinnatti.\n\nLINDSAY: Go 'head on, Lucy Taylor. Go 'head on. You know a very little\nof yo' sugar sweetens my coffee. Go 'head on. Everytime you lift yo'\narm you smell like a nest of yellow hammers.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: Go 'head on yo'self. Yo' head look like it done wore out\nthree bodies. Talkin' 'bout _me_ smellin'--you smell lak a nest of\ngrand daddies yo'self.\n\nLINDSAY: Aw rock on down de road, 'oman. Ah, don't wantuh change words\nwid yuh. Youse too ugly.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: You ain't nobody's pretty baby, yo'self. You so ugly I\nbetcha yo' wife have to spread uh sheet over yo' head tuh let sleep\nslip up on yuh.\n\nLINDSAY: (Threatening) You better git way from me while you able. I\ndone tole you I don't wanter break a breath wid you. It's uh whole\nheap better tuh walk off on yo' own legs than it is to be toted off.\nI'm tired of yo' achin' round here. You fool wid me now an' I'll knock\nyou into doll rags, Tony or no Tony.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: (Jumping up in his face) Hit me? Hit me! I dare you tuh\nhit me. If you take dat dare, you'll steal uh hawg an' eat his hair.\n\nLINDSAY: Lemme gwan down to dat church befo' you make me stomp you.\n(He exits, right.)\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: You mean you'll _git_ stomped. Ah'm goin' to de trial,\ntoo. De nex trial gointer be _me_ for kickin' some uh you Baptist\nniggers around.\n\n(A great noise is heard off stage left. The angry and jeering voices\nof children. MRS. TAYLOR looks off left and takes a step or two\ntowards left exit as the noise comes nearer.)\n\nVOICE OF ONE CHILD: Tell her! Tell her! Turn her up and smell her. Yo'\nmama ain't got nothin' to do wid me.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: (Hollering off left) You lil Baptis' haitians leave them\nchillun alone. If you don't, you better!\n\n(Enter about ten children struggling and wrestling in a bunch. MRS.\nTAYLOR looks about on the ground for a stick to strike the children\nwith.)\n\nVOICE OF CHILD: Hey! Hey! He's skeered tuh knock it off. Coward!\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: If y'all don't git on home!\n\nSASSY LITTLE GIRL: (Standing akimbo) I know you better not touch me,\ndo my mama will 'tend to you.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: (Making as if to strike her.) Shet up you nasty lil\nheifer, sassin' me! You ain't half raised.\n\n(The little girl shakes herself at MRS. TAYLOR and is joined by two or\nthree others.)\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: (Walkin' towards right exit.) I'm goin' on down to de\nchurch an' tell yo' mammy. But she ain't been half raised herself.\n(She exits right with several children making faces behind her.)\n\nONE BOY: (To sassy GIRL) Aw, haw! Y'all ol' Baptis' ain't got no\nbookcase in yo' chuch. We went there one day an' I saw uh soda cracker\nbox settin' up in de corner so I set down on it. (Pointing at sassy\nGIRL) Know what ole Mary Ella say? (Jeering laughter) Willie, you git\nup off our library! Haw! Haw!\n\nMARY ELLA: Y'all ole Meth'dis' ain't got no window panes in yo' ole\nchurch.\n\nANOTHER GIRL: (Takes center of stand, hands akimbo and shakes her\nhips) I don't keer whut y'all say, I'm a Meth'dis' bred an' uh\nMeth'dis' born an' when I'm dead there'll be uh Meth'dis' gone.\n\nMARY ELLA: (Snaps fingers under other girl's nose and starts singing.\nSeveral join her.)\n  Oh Baptis', Baptis' is my name\n  My name's written on high\n  I got my lick in de Baptis' church\n  Gointer eat up de Meth'dis' pie.\n\n(The Methodist children jeer and make faces. The Baptist camp make\nfaces back; for a full minute there is silence while each camp tries\nto outdo the other in face making. The Baptist makes the last face.)\n\nMETHODIST BOY: Come on, less us don't notice 'em. Less gwan down to\nde church an' hear de trial.\n\nMARY ELLA: Y'all ain't de onliest ones kin go. We goin', too.\n\nWILLIE: Aw, haw! Copy cats! (Makes face) Dat's right. Follow on behind\nus lak uh puppy dog tail. (They start walking toward right exit,\nswitching their clothes behind.) Dat's right. Follow on behind us lak\nuh puppy dog tail. (They start walking toward right exit, switching\ntheir clothes behind.)\n\n(Baptist children stage a rush and struggle to get in front of the\nMethodists. They finally succeed in flinging some of the Methodist\nchildren to the ground and some behind them and walk towards right\nexit haughtily switching their clothes.)\n\nWILLIE: (Whispers to his crowd) Less go round by Mosely's lot an' beat\n'em there!\n\nOTHERS: All right!\n\nWILLIE: (Yellin' to Baptists) We wouldn't walk behind no ole Baptists!\n\n(The Methodists turn and walk off towards left exit, switching their\nclothes as the Baptists are doing.)\n\n\nSLOW CURTAIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Mule-Bone:, by Zora Hurston and Langston Hughes",
