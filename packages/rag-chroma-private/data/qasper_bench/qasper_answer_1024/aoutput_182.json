    "answer": "Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention works by introducing a Gaussian weight matrix to capture the localness relationship between characters. This weight matrix assigns weights based on the distance between characters, with closer characters receiving higher weights. By combining the Gaussian weight with the score matrix produced by $Q{K^{T}}$, the attention mechanism ensures that the relationship between characters with long distances is weaker than adjacent characters. This approach allows the model to focus on the adjacent characters and their relationships, which is important for tasks like Chinese word segmentation where the order of characters is crucial. Additionally, the model uses a triangular matrix mask for the self-attention sublayer to adjust the weights between characters effectively."
