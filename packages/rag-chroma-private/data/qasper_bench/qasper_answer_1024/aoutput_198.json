    "answer": "The authors evidence the claim that many engineers find it a big overhead to choose from multiple frameworks, models, and optimization techniques by stating that building models under general-purpose deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras requires a large overhead of mastering these framework details. They also mention that higher level abstractions to hide the framework details are favored by many engineers. Additionally, they discuss how deep learning toolkits like OpenNMT and AllenNLP reduce development costs but are limited to certain tasks and not flexible enough to support new network architectures or components."
