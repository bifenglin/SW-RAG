    "answer": "The baselines for the neural architectures presented in the context were standard components combined to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on LibriSpeech and competitive results on other benchmarks. The Jasper architecture served as a good baseline approach for further exploration of regularization, data augmentation, loss functions, language models, and optimization strategies."
