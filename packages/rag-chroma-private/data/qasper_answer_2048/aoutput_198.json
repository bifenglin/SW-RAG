    "answer": "The authors evidence the claim that many engineers find it a big overhead to choose from multiple frameworks, models, and optimization techniques by stating that building models under general-purpose deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras requires a large overhead of mastering framework details. They also mention that higher level abstractions to hide framework details are favored by many engineers, indicating that the complexity of choosing and working with different frameworks is a challenge for them. Additionally, they point out that existing deep learning toolkits in NLP, such as OpenNMT and AllenNLP, while reducing development cost, are limited to certain tasks and not flexible enough to support new network architectures or components, further highlighting the difficulty engineers face in selecting the right tools for their NLP tasks."
