    "answer": "The robustness of a model is defined in the context as the ability of the model to leverage prior knowledge effectively and handle unbalanced labeled features, ultimately improving performance and working more effectively and robustly against baselines. The paper proposes three regularization terms on top of generalized expectation criteria to address the robustness problem of leveraging knowledge in learning models. These regularization terms include incorporating neutral features, maximum entropy regularization term, and KL divergence. The paper also discusses the importance of neutral features, the ability of the maximum entropy regularization term to control unbalance, and the effectiveness of KL divergence on unbalanced corpora. The main goal is to make the model more robust and practical by incorporating prior knowledge in the learning process."
