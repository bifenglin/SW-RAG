    "answer": "The approach proposed in the provided context, GM_KL (Gaussian Mixture using KL Divergence), aims to capture polysemy by obtaining multi-sense word embedding distributions. It uses a variant of max margin objective based on the asymmetric KL divergence energy function to capture textual entailment. This approach is advantageous in capturing the polysemous nature of words and reducing uncertainty per word by distributing it across senses. It also considers asymmetry in textual entailment while still capturing symmetrical similarity between words. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on benchmark word similarity and entailment datasets in the experimental section. Compared to other word sense disambiguation (WSD) approaches employing word embeddings, GM_KL shows better correlation on the SCWS dataset and achieves better performance for various metrics."
