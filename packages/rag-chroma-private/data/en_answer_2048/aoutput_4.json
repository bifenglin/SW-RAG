    "answer": "The sides of the fuselage need to be sloped (tumbled home) in order to form a conical shape. If the sides were not sloped, the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. By sloping the sides, the section formed becomes conical, which is necessary for the fuselage shape."
