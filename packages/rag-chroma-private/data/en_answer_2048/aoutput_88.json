    "answer": "The proposed approach in this research paper is to provide a probabilistic interpretation of the least-mean-square filter, leading to an adaptable step-size LMS algorithm that performs well in both stationary and tracking scenarios. This approach has fewer free parameters than previous methods and provides a clear physical meaning to these parameters. The use of a probabilistic model also allows for easy extension and adaptation, such as using different types of Gaussian distributions or transition models."
