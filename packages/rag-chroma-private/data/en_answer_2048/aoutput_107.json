    "answer": "The framework captures the reduced-order dynamics by using a propagator in the latent space, which involves complex-valued latent variables treated independently. This approach enables the model to have interpretable latent dynamics and makes it suitable for training in the Small Data regime due to the small number of required parameters. The continuous ODE in the complex plane is used for each dimension of the latent variable to define the operator, allowing for the description of system dynamics similar to an eigenvalue, where the real part represents growth and decay and the imaginary part represents the periodic component."
