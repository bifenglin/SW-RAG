    "answer": "The models used for dialect identification were BERT and RoBERTa with a linear layer connected to the pooler output of the models. Additionally, fine-tuning was done on the models for dialect identification using samples corresponding to specific languages. Other pretrained models like XLM-RoBERTa, ELECTRA, GPT-2, and RoBERTa were also experimented with for the task of dialect identification."
