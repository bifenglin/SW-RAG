    "answer": "A media application determines the context of an event by using multiple types of content-recognition modules and/or algorithms to process data associated with the event. This may include cross-referencing the data in a database indicating the different contexts the event may have. Additionally, the media application may analyze the words spoken and/or actions by the person during the event, as well as the words and/or actions during a predetermined amount of time before and/or after the event in order to better understand the context."
