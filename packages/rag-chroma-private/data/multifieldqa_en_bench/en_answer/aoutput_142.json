    "answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble by influencing its speed. In the shock compression stage, a smaller specific-heat ratio results in slower average motion, while a larger specific-heat ratio speeds up the average motion of the bubbles after the shock wave passes through."
