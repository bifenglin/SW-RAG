    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl, which allows for a unique rectification functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems. It also plays a key role in the interlayer hybridization of electronic states under the chiral crystal symmetry characteristic of twisted bilayers, leading to the development of a dc Hall current that can be controlled by the phase difference of two driving fields."
