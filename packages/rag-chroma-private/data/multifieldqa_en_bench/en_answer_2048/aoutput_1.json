    "answer": "Based on the provided context, the ISR (Integrated Stress Response) is not necessary for the reactivation of the transgene. This is supported by the fact that inhibiting the ISR using ISRIB did not affect the reactivation of the transgene, and knockdown of the downstream effector ATF4 also did not interfere with the reactivation of the transgene."
