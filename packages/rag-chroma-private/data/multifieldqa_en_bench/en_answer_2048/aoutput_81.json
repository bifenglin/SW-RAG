    "answer": "A media application determines the context of an event by using content-recognition modules and algorithms to analyze the words spoken and actions during the event. It may also analyze the words and actions before and after the event to better understand the context. Additionally, the media application may cross-reference the information obtained from the content-recognition module with a database to determine the meaning of certain terms used in the event. The relationships between words and information obtained are also processed to determine the nature of the event and generate supplemental information."
