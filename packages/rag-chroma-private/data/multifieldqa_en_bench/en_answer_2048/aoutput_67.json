    "answer": "The conduction gap depends on the strain direction as the data shows that the conduction gap values vary for different strain directions. For example, the conduction gap values are different for strain directions of $0^{\\circ}$, $30^{\\circ}$, and $90^{\\circ}$. Additionally, the conduction gap has peaks at specific strain angles for both tensile and compressive strains, indicating a dependence on the direction of strain."
