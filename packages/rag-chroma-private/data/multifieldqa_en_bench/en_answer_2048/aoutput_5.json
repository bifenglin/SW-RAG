    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity can induce pairing in quantum dots and tends to suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap becomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature. Additionally, the strength of superconducting pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime, enhancing the Kondo effect for quantum dots attached to superconducting and normal contacts, while tending to suppress both the SU(2) and SU(4) Kondo effects for DQD-based Cooper pair splitters. The non-local pairing induced by superconducting proximity effect can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening, and relatively small values of coupling to superconductivity are sufficient for the effect to occur."
