    "answer": "Smartphones and tablets are different from a technical perspective in terms of power budget for their SoCs, default connectivity (Wi-Fi for tablets and cellular modem for smartphones), and design variability (wider range of tablet designs compared to smartphones). Additionally, tablets eschew cellular modems which allows for faster time to market and direct sales to consumers, while smartphones are more powerful due to subsidies and tend to have more powerful SoCs than tablets."
