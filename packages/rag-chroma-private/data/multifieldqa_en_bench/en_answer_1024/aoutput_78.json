    "answer": "The significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability is that it plays a crucial role in the geometric origin of the effect in twisted bilayers. It leads to the development of a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl, which allows for the control of a dc Hall current and provides a unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers."
