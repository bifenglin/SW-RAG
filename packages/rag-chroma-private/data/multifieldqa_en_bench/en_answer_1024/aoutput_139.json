    "answer": "The potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system is promising, as they have been shown to be better models of the biological visual cortex compared to traditional models in the neuroscience community. SNNs have been successful at predicting neural responses in the primate visual cortex, matching the hierarchy of the ventral visual stream, and even controlling neural activity. Additionally, as training paradigms of mice and techniques for collecting neural activity have improved, there is a strong interest in exploring the mouse visual cortex using SNNs. The use of SNNs as a novel and powerful tool for research on the visual system has been demonstrated, and further exploration of their potential is highly promising for explaining the complex and diverse vision systems in the future."
