    "answer": "Based on the provided context, the ISR (Integrated Stress Response) is not necessary for transgene reactivation. This is supported by the findings that the activation of the ISR pathway, including eIF2Î± phosphorylation and downstream effectors like CHOP, did not interfere with the reactivation of the transgene in HepG2 cells. Additionally, pharmacological inhibitors of the ISR did not prevent the reactivation of the transgene."
