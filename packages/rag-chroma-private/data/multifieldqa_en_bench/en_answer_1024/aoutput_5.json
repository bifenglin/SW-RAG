    "answer": "The proximity of superconductivity can either enhance or suppress the Kondo effect, depending on the specific circumstances. It can enhance the Kondo effect for quantum dots attached to both superconducting and normal contacts, while it tends to suppress the Kondo effect for DQD-based Cooper pair splitters. Additionally, non-local pairing induced by superconducting proximity effect can be the sole cause of Kondo screening, and relatively small values of coupling to superconductivity are sufficient for this effect to occur."
