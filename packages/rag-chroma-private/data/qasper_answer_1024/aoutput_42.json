    "answer": "The models are evaluated in the human-machine communication game based on their ability to encode the target sentence into keywords and decode the keywords to generate the target sequence. The encoding strategy is evaluated using an encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder encodes the target sentence into keywords, and the decoder attempts to guess the target sequence based on the keywords. The autocomplete system's decoding strategy is modeled as a probabilistic model that conditions on the keywords and returns a distribution over predictions. The models are evaluated based on their ability to efficiently and accurately communicate the target sequence using the specified keywords."
