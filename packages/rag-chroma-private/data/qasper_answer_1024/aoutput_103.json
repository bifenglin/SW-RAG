    "answer": "Based on the provided context, the answered questions do not directly measure the usefulness of the answer. The context primarily focuses on the characterization of questions based on their quality and the factors that determine whether a question remains open or unanswered. It discusses linguistic activities and features that can help predict whether a question will be answered or not, but it does not explicitly mention measuring the usefulness of the answer in relation to the answered questions."
