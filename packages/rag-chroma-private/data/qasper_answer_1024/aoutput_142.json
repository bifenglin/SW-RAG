    "answer": "The authors present evidence that using the pre-trained BERT model and fine-tuning it on the downstream task can outperform previous works in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. They further mention that examining the results shows the ability of the model to detect biases in the process of collecting or annotating datasets, which can be valuable for debiasing hate speech datasets in future studies."
