    "answer": "The experiments conducted involve sampling 50 non-ironic input sentences and their corresponding output sentences from different models.

The output sentences were ranked from best to worst, with the best output ranked as 1 and the worst output ranked as 6. Additionally, automatic evaluations were conducted, and the results were similar to the human evaluation results."
