Since\n1830, the true Salon no longer exists. The Louvre has again been taken\nby assault,--this time by a populace of artists who have maintained\nthemselves in it.\n\nIn other days, when the Salon presented only the choicest works of art,\nit conferred the highest honor on the creations there exhibited. Among\nthe two hundred selected paintings, the public could still choose: a\ncrown was awarded to the masterpiece by hands unseen. Eager, impassioned\ndiscussions arose about some picture. The abuse showered on Delacroix,\non Ingres, contributed no less to their fame than the praises and\nfanaticism of their adherents. To-day, neither the crowd nor the\ncriticism grows impassioned about the products of that bazaar. Forced to\nmake the selection for itself, which in former days the examining\njury made for it, the attention of the public is soon wearied and the\nexhibition closes. Before the year 1817 the pictures admitted never went\nbeyond the first two columns of the long gallery of the old masters; but\nin that year, to the great astonishment of the public, they filled the\nwhole space. Historical, high-art, genre paintings, easel pictures,\nlandscapes, flowers, animals, and water-colors,--these eight specialties\ncould surely not offer more than twenty pictures in one year worthy of\nthe eyes of the public, which, indeed, cannot give its attention to a\ngreater number of such works. The more the number of artists increases,\nthe more careful and exacting the jury of admission ought to be.\n\nThe true character of the Salon was lost as soon as it spread along\nthe galleries. The Salon should have remained within fixed limits of\ninflexible proportions, where each distinct specialty could show its\nmasterpieces only. An experience of ten years has shown the excellence\nof the former institution. Now, instead of a tournament, we have a mob;\ninstead of a noble exhibition, we have a tumultuous bazaar; instead of\na choice selection we have a chaotic mass. What is the result? A great\nartist is swamped. Decamps' \"Turkish Cafe,\" \"Children at a Fountain,\"\n\"Joseph,\" and \"The Torture,\" would have redounded far more to his credit\nif the four pictures had been exhibited in the great Salon with the\nhundred good pictures of that year, than his twenty pictures could,\namong three thousand others, jumbled together in six galleries.\n\nBy some strange contradiction, ever since the doors are open to every\none there has been much talk of unknown and unrecognized genius. When,\ntwelve years earlier, Ingres' \"Courtesan,\" and that of Sigalon, the\n\"Medusa\" of Gericault, the \"Massacre of Scio\" by Delacroix, the \"Baptism\nof Henri IV.\" by Eugene Deveria, admitted by celebrated artists accused\nof jealousy, showed the world, in spite of the denials of criticism,\nthat young and vigorous palettes existed, no such complaint was made.\nNow, when the veriest dauber of canvas can send in his work, the whole\ntalk is of genius neglected! Where judgment no longer exists, there is\nno longer anything judged. But whatever artists may be doing now, they\nwill come back in time to the examination and selection which presents\ntheir works to the admiration of the crowd for whom they work. Without\nselection by the Academy there will be no Salon, and without the Salon\nart may perish.\n\nEver since the catalogue has grown into a book, many names have appeared\nin it which still remain in their native obscurity, in spite of the ten\nor a dozen pictures attached to them. Among these names perhaps the most\nunknown to fame is that of an artist named Pierre Grassou, coming from\nFougeres, and called simply \"Fougeres\" among his brother-artists, who,\nat the present moment holds a place, as the saying is, \"in the sun,\" and\nwho suggested the rather bitter reflections by which this sketch of\nhis life is introduced,--reflections that are applicable to many other\nindividuals of the tribe of artists.\n\nIn 1832, Fougeres lived in the rue de Navarin, on the fourth floor of\none of those tall, narrow houses which resemble the obelisk of Luxor,\nand possess an alley, a dark little stairway with dangerous turnings,\nthree windows only on each floor, and, within the building, a courtyard,\nor, to speak more correctly, a square pit or well. Above the three or\nfour rooms occupied by Grassou of Fougeres was his studio, looking over\nto Montmartre. This studio was painted in brick-color, for a background;\nthe floor was tinted brown and well frotted; each chair was furnished\nwith a bit of carpet bound round the edges; the sofa, simple enough, was\nclean as that in the bedroom of some worthy bourgeoise. All these things\ndenoted the tidy ways of a small mind and the thrift of a poor man. A\nbureau was there, in which to put away the studio implements, a table\nfor breakfast, a sideboard, a secretary; in short, all the articles\nnecessary to a painter, neatly arranged and very clean. The stove\nparticipated in this Dutch cleanliness, which was all the more visible\nbecause the pure and little changing light from the north flooded with\nits cold clear beams the vast apartment. Fougeres, being merely a genre\npainter, does not need the immense machinery and outfit which ruin\nhistorical painters; he has never recognized within himself sufficient\nfaculty to attempt high-art, and he therefore clings to easel painting.\n\nAt the beginning of the month of December of that year, a season at\nwhich the bourgeois of Paris conceive, periodically, the burlesque idea\nof perpetuating their forms and figures already too bulky in themselves,\nPierre Grassou, who had risen early, prepared his palette, and lighted\nhis stove, was eating a roll steeped in milk, and waiting till the frost\non his windows had melted sufficiently to let the full light in. The\nweather was fine and dry. At this moment the artist, who ate his bread\nwith that patient, resigned air that tells so much, heard and recognized\nthe step of a man who had upon his life the influence such men have\non the lives of nearly all artists,--the step of Elie Magus, a\npicture-dealer, a usurer in canvas. The next moment Elie Magus entered\nand found the painter in the act of beginning his work in the tidy\nstudio.\n\n\"How are you, old rascal?\" said the painter.\n\nFougeres had the cross of the Legion of honor, and Elie Magus bought his\npictures at two and three hundred francs apiece, so he gave himself the\nairs of a fine artist.\n\n\"Business is very bad,\" replied Elie. \"You artists have such\npretensions! You talk of two hundred francs when you haven't put six\nsous' worth of color on a canvas. However, you are a good fellow, I'll\nsay that. You are steady; and I've come to put a good bit of business in\nyour way.\"\n\n\"Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,\" said Fougeres. \"Do you know Latin?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, it means that the Greeks never proposed a good bit of business\nto the Trojans without getting their fair share of it. In the olden time\nthey used to say, 'Take my horse.' Now we say, 'Take my bear.' Well,\nwhat do you want, Ulysses-Lagingeole-Elie Magus?\"\n\nThese words will give an idea of the mildness and wit with which\nFougeres employed what painters call studio fun.\n\n\"Well, I don't deny that you are to paint me two pictures for nothing.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\"\n\n\"I'll leave you to do it, or not; I don't ask it. But you're an honest\nman.\"\n\n\"Come, out with it!\"\n\n\"Well, I'm prepared to bring you a father, mother, and only daughter.\"\n\n\"All for me?\"\n\n\"Yes--they want their portraits taken. These bourgeois--they are crazy\nabout art--have never dared to enter a studio. The girl has a 'dot' of a\nhundred thousand francs. You can paint all three,--perhaps they'll turn\nout family portraits.\"\n\nAnd with that the old Dutch log of wood who passed for a man and who was\ncalled Elie Magus, interrupted himself to laugh an uncanny laugh which\nfrightened the painter. He fancied he heard Mephistopheles talking\nmarriage.\n\n\"Portraits bring five hundred francs apiece,\" went on Elie; \"so you can\nvery well afford to paint me three pictures.\"\n\n\"True for you!\" cried Fougeres, gleefully.\n\n\"And if you marry the girl, you won't forget me.\"\n\n\"Marry! I?\" cried Pierre Grassou,--\"I, who have a habit of sleeping\nalone; and get up at cock-crow, and all my life arranged--\"\n\n\"One hundred thousand francs,\" said Magus, \"and a quiet girl, full of\ngolden tones, as you call 'em, like a Titian.\"\n\n\"What class of people are they?\"\n\n\"Retired merchants; just now in love with art; have a country-house at\nVille d'Avray, and ten or twelve thousand francs a year.\"\n\n\"What business did they do?\"\n\n\"Bottles.\"\n\n\"Now don't say that word; it makes me think of corks and sets my teeth\non edge.\"\n\n\"Am I to bring them?\"\n\n\"Three portraits--I could put them in the Salon; I might go in for\nportrait-painting. Well, yes!\"\n\nOld Elie descended the staircase to go in search of the Vervelle family.\nTo know to what extend this proposition would act upon the painter, and\nwhat effect would be produced upon him by the Sieur and Dame Vervelle,\nadorned by their only daughter, it is necessary to cast an eye on the\nanterior life of Pierre Grassou of Fougeres.\n\nWhen a pupil, Fougeres had studied drawing with Servin, who was\nthought a great draughtsman in academic circles. After that he went to\nSchinner's, to learn the secrets of the powerful and magnificent color\nwhich distinguishes that master. Master and scholars were all discreet;\nat any rate Pierre discovered none of their secrets. From there he went\nto Sommervieux' atelier, to acquire that portion of the art of painting\nwhich is called composition, but composition was shy and distant to him.\nThen he tried to snatch from Decamps and Granet the mystery of their\ninterior effects. The two masters were not robbed. Finally Fougeres\nended his education with Duval-Lecamus. During these studied and\nthese different transformations Fougeres' habits and ways of life were\ntranquil and moral to a degree that furnished matter of jesting to the\nvarious ateliers where he sojourned; but everywhere he disarmed his\ncomrades by his modesty and by the patience and gentleness of a lamblike\nnature. The masters, however, had no sympathy for the good lad; masters\nprefer bright fellows, eccentric spirits, droll or fiery, or else gloomy\nand deeply reflective, which argue future talent. Everything about\nPierre Grassou smacked of mediocrity. His nickname \"Fougeres\" (that\nof the painter in the play of \"The Eglantine\") was the source of much\nteasing; but, by force of circumstances, he accepted the name of the\ntown in which he had first seen light.\n\nGrassou of Fougeres resembled his name. Plump and of medium height, he\nhad a dull complexion, brown eyes, black hair, a turned-up nose, rather\nwide mouth, and long ears. His gentle, passive, and resigned air gave a\ncertain relief to these leading features of a physiognomy that was full\nof health, but wanting in action. This young man, born to be a virtuous\nbourgeois, having left his native place and come to Paris to be clerk\nwith a color-merchant (formerly of Mayenne and a distant connection of\nthe Orgemonts) made himself a painter simply by the fact of an obstinacy\nwhich constitutes the Breton character. What he suffered, the manner in\nwhich he lived during those years of study, God only knows. He suffered\nas much as great men suffer when they are hounded by poverty and hunted\nlike wild beasts by the pack of commonplace minds and by troops of\nvanities athirst for vengeance.\n\nAs soon as he thought himself able to fly on his own wings, Fougeres\ntook a studio in the upper part of the rue des Martyrs, where he began\nto delve his way. He made his first appearance in 1819. The first\npicture he presented to the jury of the Exhibition at the Louvre\nrepresented a village wedding rather laboriously copied from Greuze's\npicture. It was rejected. When Fougeres heard of the fatal decision,\nhe did not fall into one of those fits of epileptic self-love to which\nstrong natures give themselves up, and which sometimes end in challenges\nsent to the director or the secretary of the Museum, or even by threats\nof assassination. Fougeres quietly fetched his canvas, wrapped it in\na handkerchief, and brought it home, vowing in his heart that he would\nstill make himself a great painter. He placed his picture on the easel,\nand went to one of his former masters, a man of immense talent,--to\nSchinner, a kind and patient artist, whose triumph at that year's Salon\nwas complete. Fougeres asked him to come and criticise the rejected\nwork. The great painter left everything and went at once. When poor\nFougeres had placed the work before him Schinner, after a glance,\npressed Fougeres' hand.\n\n\"You are a fine fellow,\" he said; \"you've a heart of gold, and I must\nnot deceive you. Listen; you are fulfilling all the promises you made in\nthe studios. When you find such things as that at the tip of your brush,\nmy good Fougeres, you had better leave colors with Brullon, and not take\nthe canvas of others. Go home early, put on your cotton night-cap, and\nbe in bed by nine o'clock. The next morning early go to some government\noffice, ask for a place, and give up art.\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said Fougeres, \"my picture is already condemned; it is\nnot a verdict that I want of you, but the cause of that verdict.\"\n\n\"Well--you paint gray and sombre; you see nature being a crape veil;\nyour drawing is heavy, pasty; your composition is a medley of Greuze,\nwho only redeemed his defects by the qualities which you lack.\"\n\nWhile detailing these faults of the picture Schinner saw on Fougeres'\nface so deep an expression of sadness that he carried him off to dinner\nand tried to console him. The next morning at seven o'clock Fougeres was\nat his easel working over the rejected picture; he warmed the colors; he\nmade the corrections suggested by Schinner, he touched up his figures.\nThen, disgusted with such patching, he carried the picture to Elie\nMagus. Elie Magus, a sort of Dutch-Flemish-Belgian, had three reasons\nfor being what he became,--rich and avaricious. Coming last from\nBordeaux, he was just starting in Paris, selling old pictures and living\non the boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle. Fougeres, who relied on his palette\nto go to the baker's, bravely ate bread and nuts, or bread and milk, or\nbread and cherries, or bread and cheese, according to the seasons. Elie\nMagus, to whom Pierre offered his first picture, eyed it for some time\nand then gave him fifteen francs.\n\n\"With fifteen francs a year coming in, and a thousand francs for\nexpenses,\" said Fougeres, smiling, \"a man will go fast and far.\"\n\nElie Magus made a gesture; he bit his thumbs, thinking that he might\nhave had that picture for five francs.\n\nFor several days Pierre walked down from the rue des Martyrs and\nstationed himself at the corner of the boulevard opposite to Elie's\nshop, whence his eye could rest upon his picture, which did not obtain\nany notice from the eyes of the passers along the street. At the end of\na week the picture disappeared; Fougeres walked slowly up and approached\nthe dealer's shop in a lounging manner. The Jew was at his door.\n\n\"Well, I see you have sold my picture.\"\n\n\"No, here it is,\" said Magus; \"I've framed it, to show it to some one\nwho fancies he knows about painting.\"\n\nFougeres had not the heart to return to the boulevard. He set about\nanother picture, and spent two months upon it,--eating mouse's meals and\nworking like a galley-slave.\n\nOne evening he went to the boulevard, his feet leading him fatefully to\nthe dealer's shop. His picture was not to be seen.\n\n\"I've sold your picture,\" said Elie Magus, seeing him.\n\n\"For how much?\"\n\n\"I got back what I gave and a small interest. Make me some Flemish\ninteriors, a lesson of anatomy, landscapes, and such like, and I'll buy\nthem of you,\" said Elie.\n\nFougeres would fain have taken old Magus in his arms; he regarded him as\na father. He went home with joy in his heart; the great painter Schinner\nwas mistaken after all! In that immense city of Paris there were some\nhearts that beat in unison with Pierre's; his talent was understood and\nappreciated. The poor fellow of twenty-seven had the innocence of a lad\nof sixteen. Another man, one of those distrustful, surly artists, would\nhave noticed the diabolical look on Elie's face and seen the twitching\nof the hairs of his beard, the irony of his moustache, and the movement\nof his shoulders which betrayed the satisfaction of Walter Scott's Jew\nin swindling a Christian.\n\nFougeres marched along the boulevard in a state of joy which gave to his\nhonest face an expression of pride. He was like a schoolboy protecting\na woman. He met Joseph Bridau, one of his comrades, and one of those\neccentric geniuses destined to fame and sorrow. Joseph Bridau, who had,\nto use his own expression, a few sous in his pocket, took Fougeres to\nthe Opera. But Fougeres didn't see the ballet, didn't hear the music; he\nwas imagining pictures, he was painting. He left Joseph in the middle\nof the evening, and ran home to make sketches by lamp-light. He invented\nthirty pictures, all reminiscence, and felt himself a man of genius. The\nnext day he bought colors, and canvases of various dimensions; he piled\nup bread and cheese on his table, he filled a water-pot with water,\nhe laid in a provision of wood for his stove; then, to use a studio\nexpression, he dug at his pictures. He hired several models and Magus\nlent him stuffs.\n\nAfter two months' seclusion the Breton had finished four pictures. Again\nhe asked counsel of Schinner, this time adding Bridau to the invitation.\nThe two painters saw in three of these pictures a servile imitation\nof Dutch landscapes and interiors by Metzu, in the fourth a copy of\nRembrandt's \"Lesson of Anatomy.\"\n\n\"Still imitating!\" said Schinner. \"Ah! Fougeres can't manage to be\noriginal.\"\n\n\"You ought to do something else than painting,\" said Bridau.\n\n\"What?\" asked Fougeres.\n\n\"Fling yourself into literature.\"\n\nFougeres lowered his head like a sheep when it rains. Then he asked and\nobtained certain useful advice, and retouched his pictures before taking\nthem to Elie Magus. Elie paid him twenty-five francs apiece. At that\nprice of course Fougeres earned nothing; neither did he lose, thanks to\nhis sober living. He made a few excursions to the boulevard to see what\nbecame of his pictures, and there he underwent a singular hallucination.\nHis neat, clean paintings, hard as tin and shiny as porcelain, were\ncovered with a sort of mist; they looked like old daubs. Magus was out,\nand Pierre could obtain no information on this phenomenon. He fancied\nsomething was wrong with his eyes.\n\nThe painter went back to his studio and made more pictures. After seven\nyears of continued toil Fougeres managed to compose and execute quite\npassable work. He did as well as any artist of the second class.\nElie bought and sold all the paintings of the poor Breton, who earned\nlaboriously about two thousand francs a year while he spent but twelve\nhundred.\n\nAt the Exhibition of 1829, Leon de Lora, Schinner, and Bridau, who all\nthree occupied a great position and were, in fact, at the head of the\nart movement, were filled with pity for the perseverance and the poverty\nof their old friend; and they caused to be admitted into the grand salon\nof the Exhibition, a picture by Fougeres. This picture, powerful in\ninterest but derived from Vigneron as to sentiment and from Dubufe's\nfirst manner as to execution, represented a young man in prison, whose\nhair was being cut around the nape of the neck. On one side was\na priest, on the other two women, one old, one young, in tears. A\nsheriff's clerk was reading aloud a document. On a wretched table was a\nmeal, untouched. The light came in through the bars of a window near\nthe ceiling. It was a picture fit to make the bourgeois shudder, and\nthe bourgeois shuddered. Fougeres had simply been inspired by the\nmasterpiece of Gerard Douw; he had turned the group of the \"Dropsical\nWoman\" toward the window, instead of presenting it full front. The\ncondemned man was substituted for the dying woman--same pallor, same\nglance, same appeal to God. Instead of the Dutch doctor, he had painted\nthe cold, official figure of the sheriff's clerk attired in black; but\nhe had added an old woman to the young one of Gerard Douw. The cruelly\nsimple and good-humored face of the executioner completed and dominated\nthe group. This plagiarism, very cleverly disguised, was not discovered.\nThe catalogue contained the following:--\n\n     510. Grassou de Fougeres (Pierre), rue de Navarin, 2.\n     Death-toilet of a Chouan, condemned to execution in 1809.\n\nThough wholly second-rate, the picture had immense success, for it\nrecalled the affair of the \"chauffeurs,\" of Mortagne. A crowd collected\nevery day before the now fashionable canvas; even Charles X. paused to\nlook at it. \"Madame,\" being told of the patient life of the poor Breton,\nbecame enthusiastic over him. The Duc d'Orleans asked the price of\nthe picture. The clergy told Madame la Dauphine that the subject was\nsuggestive of good thoughts; and there was, in truth, a most satisfying\nreligious tone about it. Monseigneur the Dauphin admired the dust on\nthe stone-floor,--a huge blunder, by the way, for Fougeres had painted\ngreenish tones suggestive of mildew along the base of the walls.\n\"Madame\" finally bought the picture for a thousand francs, and the\nDauphin ordered another like it. Charles X. gave the cross of the Legion\nof honor to this son of a peasant who had fought for the royal cause\nin 1799. (Joseph Bridau, the great painter, was not yet decorated.) The\nminister of the Interior ordered two church pictures of Fougeres.\n\nThis Salon of 1829 was to Pierre Grassou his whole fortune, fame,\nfuture, and life. Be original, invent, and you die by inches; copy,\nimitate, and you'll live. After this discovery of a gold mine, Grassou\nde Fougeres obtained his benefit of the fatal principle to which society\nowes the wretched mediocrities to whom are intrusted in these days the\nelection of leaders in all social classes; who proceed, naturally, to\nelect themselves and who wage a bitter war against all true talent. The\nprinciple of election applied indiscriminately is false, and France will\nsome day abandon it.\n\nNevertheless the modesty, simplicity, and genuine surprise of the good\nand gentle Fougeres silenced all envy and all recriminations. Besides,\nhe had on his side all of his clan who had succeeded, and all who\nexpected to succeed. Some persons, touched by the persistent energy of a\nman whom nothing had discouraged, talked of Domenichino and said:--\n\n\"Perseverance in the arts should be rewarded. Grassou hasn't stolen his\nsuccesses; he has delved for ten years, the poor dear man!\"\n\nThat exclamation of \"poor dear man!\" counted for half in the support\nand the congratulations which the painter received. Pity sets up\nmediocrities as envy pulls down great talents, and in equal numbers.\nThe newspapers, it is true, did not spare criticism, but the chevalier\nFougeres digested them as he had digested the counsel of his friends,\nwith angelic patience.\n\nPossessing, by this time, fifteen thousand francs, laboriously earned,\nhe furnished an apartment and studio in the rue de Navarin, and painted\nthe picture ordered by Monseigneur the Dauphin, also the two church\npictures, and delivered them at the time agreed on, with a punctuality\nthat was very discomforting to the exchequer of the ministry, accustomed\nto a different course of action. But--admire the good fortune of men who\nare methodical--if Grassou, belated with his work, had been caught by\nthe revolution of July he would not have got his money.\n\nBy the time he was thirty-seven Fougeres had manufactured for Elie Magus\nsome two hundred pictures, all of them utterly unknown, by the help of\nwhich he had attained to that satisfying manner, that point of execution\nbefore which the true artist shrugs his shoulders and the bourgeoisie\nworships. Fougeres was dear to friends for rectitude of ideas, for\nsteadiness of sentiment, absolute kindliness, and great loyalty; though\nthey had no esteem for his palette, they loved the man who held it.\n\n\"What a misfortune it is that Fougeres has the vice of painting!\" said\nhis comrades.\n\nBut for all this, Grassou gave excellent counsel, like those\nfeuilletonists incapable of writing a book who know very well where a\nbook is wanting. There was this difference, however, between literary\ncritics and Fougeres; he was eminently sensitive to beauties; he felt\nthem, he acknowledged them, and his advice was instinct with a spirit\nof justice that made the justness of his remarks acceptable. After\nthe revolution of July, Fougeres sent about ten pictures a year to the\nSalon, of which the jury admitted four or five. He lived with the most\nrigid economy, his household being managed solely by an old charwoman.\nFor all amusement he visited his friends, he went to see works of art,\nhe allowed himself a few little trips about France, and he planned to go\nto Switzerland in search of inspiration. This detestable artist was an\nexcellent citizen; he mounted guard duly, went to reviews, and paid his\nrent and provision-bills with bourgeois punctuality.\n\nHaving lived all his life in toil and poverty, he had never had the time\nto love. Poor and a bachelor, until now he did not desire to complicate\nhis simple life. Incapable of devising any means of increasing his\nlittle fortune, he carried, every three months, to his notary, Cardot,\nhis quarterly earnings and economies. When the notary had received\nabout three thousand francs he invested them in some first mortgage, the\ninterest of which he drew himself and added to the quarterly payments\nmade to him by Fougeres. The painter was awaiting the fortunate moment\nwhen his property thus laid by would give him the imposing income of two\nthousand francs, to allow himself the otium cum dignitate of the\nartist and paint pictures; but oh! what pictures! true pictures! each a\nfinished picture! chouette, Koxnoff, chocnosoff! His future, his dreams\nof happiness, the superlative of his hopes--do you know what it was?\nTo enter the Institute and obtain the grade of officer of the Legion\nof honor; to side down beside Schinner and Leon de Lora, to reach the\nAcademy before Bridau, to wear a rosette in his buttonhole! What a\ndream! It is only commonplace men who think of everything.\n\nHearing the sound of several steps on the staircase, Fougeres rubbed up\nhis hair, buttoned his jacket of bottle-green velveteen, and was not a\nlittle amazed to see, entering his doorway, a simpleton face vulgarly\ncalled in studio slang a \"melon.\" This fruit surmounted a pumpkin,\nclothed in blue cloth adorned with a bunch of tintinnabulating baubles.\nThe melon puffed like a walrus; the pumpkin advanced on turnips,\nimproperly called legs. A true painter would have turned the little\nbottle-vendor off at once, assuring him that he didn't paint vegetables.\nThis painter looked at his client without a smile, for Monsieur Vervelle\nwore a three-thousand-franc diamond in the bosom of his shirt.\n\nFougeres glanced at Magus and said: \"There's fat in it!\" using a slang\nterm then much in vogue in the studios.\n\nHearing those words Monsieur Vervelle frowned. The worthy bourgeois drew\nafter him another complication of vegetables in the persons of his wife\nand daughter. The wife had a fine veneer of mahogany on her face, and\nin figure she resembled a cocoa-nut, surmounted by a head and tied in\naround the waist. She pivoted on her legs, which were tap-rooted,\nand her gown was yellow with black stripes. She proudly exhibited\nunutterable mittens on a puffy pair of hands; the plumes of a\nfirst-class funeral floated on an over-flowing bonnet; laces adorned\nher shoulders, as round behind as they were before; consequently, the\nspherical form of the cocoa-nut was perfect. Her feet, of a kind that\npainters call abatis, rose above the varnished leather of the shoes in a\nswelling that was some inches high. How the feet were ever got into the\nshoes, no one knows.\n\nFollowing these vegetable parents was a young asparagus, who presented\na tiny head with smoothly banded hair of the yellow-carroty tone that a\nRoman adores, long, stringy arms, a fairly white skin with reddish spots\nupon it, large innocent eyes, and white lashes, scarcely any brows, a\nleghorn bonnet bound with white satin and adorned with two honest bows\nof the same satin, hands virtuously red, and the feet of her mother. The\nfaces of these three beings wore, as they looked round the studio, an\nair of happiness which bespoke in them a respectable enthusiasm for Art.\n\n\"So it is you, monsieur, who are going to take our likenesses?\" said the\nfather, assuming a jaunty air.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied Grassou.\n\n\"Vervelle, he has the cross!\" whispered the wife to the husband while\nthe painter's back was turned.\n\n\"Should I be likely to have our portraits painted by an artist who\nwasn't decorated?\" returned the former bottle-dealer.\n\nElie Magus here bowed to the Vervelle family and went away. Grassou\naccompanied him to the landing.\n\n\"There's no one but you who would fish up such whales.\"\n\n\"One hundred thousand francs of 'dot'!\"\n\n\"Yes, but what a family!\"\n\n\"Three hundred thousand francs of expectations, a house in the rue\nBoucherat, and a country-house at Ville d'Avray!\"\n\n\"Bottles and corks! bottles and corks!\" said the painter; \"they set my\nteeth on edge.\"\n\n\"Safe from want for the rest of your days,\" said Elie Magus as he\ndeparted.\n\nThat idea entered the head of Pierre Grassou as the daylight had burst\ninto his garret that morning.\n\nWhile he posed the father of the young person, he thought the\nbottle-dealer had a good countenance, and he admired the face full\nof violent tones. The mother and daughter hovered about the easel,\nmarvelling at all his preparations; they evidently thought him a\ndemigod. This visible admiration pleased Fougeres. The golden calf threw\nupon the family its fantastic reflections.\n\n\"You must earn lots of money; but of course you don't spend it as you\nget it,\" said the mother.\n\n\"No, madame,\" replied the painter; \"I don't spend it; I have not the\nmeans to amuse myself. My notary invests my money; he knows what I have;\nas soon as I have taken him the money I never think of it again.\"\n\n\"I've always been told,\" cried old Vervelle, \"that artists were baskets\nwith holes in them.\"\n\n\"Who is your notary--if it is not indiscreet to ask?\" said Madame\nVervelle.\n\n\"A good fellow, all round,\" replied Grassou. \"His name is Cardot.\"\n\n\"Well, well! if that isn't a joke!\" exclaimed Vervelle. \"Cardot is our\nnotary too.\"\n\n\"Take care! don't move,\" said the painter.\n\n\"Do pray hold still, Antenor,\" said the wife. \"If you move about you'll\nmake monsieur miss; you should just see him working, and then you'd\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Oh! why didn't you have me taught the arts?\" said Mademoiselle Vervelle\nto her parents.\n\n\"Virginie,\" said her mother, \"a young person ought not to learn certain\nthings. When you are married--well, till then, keep quiet.\"\n\nDuring this first sitting the Vervelle family became almost intimate\nwith the worthy artist. They were to come again two days later. As they\nwent away the father told Virginie to walk in front; but in spite of\nthis separation, she overheard the following words, which naturally\nawakened her curiosity.\n\n\"Decorated--thirty-seven years old--an artist who gets orders--puts his\nmoney with our notary. We'll consult Cardot. Hein! Madame de Fougeres!\nnot a bad name--doesn't look like a bad man either! One might prefer a\nmerchant; but before a merchant retires from business one can never know\nwhat one's daughter may come to; whereas an economical artist--and then\nyou know we love Art--Well, we'll see!\"\n\nWhile the Vervelle family discussed Pierre Grassou, Pierre Grassou\ndiscussed in his own mind the Vervelle family. He found it impossible to\nstay peacefully in his studio, so he took a walk on the boulevard, and\nlooked at all the red-haired women who passed him. He made a series of\nthe oddest reasonings to himself: gold was the handsomest of metals; a\ntawny yellow represented gold; the Romans were fond of red-haired women,\nand he turned Roman, etc. After two years of marriage what man would\never care about the color of his wife's hair? Beauty fades,--but\nugliness remains! Money is one-half of all happiness. That night when he\nwent to bed the painter had come to think Virginie Vervelle charming.\n\nWhen the three Vervelles arrived on the day of the second sitting the\nartist received them with smiles. The rascal had shaved and put on clean\nlinen; he had also arranged his hair in a pleasing manner, and chosen\na very becoming pair of trousers and red leather slippers with pointed\ntoes. The family replied with smiles as flattering as those of the\nartist. Virginie became the color of her hair, lowered her eyes, and\nturned aside her head to look at the sketches. Pierre Grassou thought\nthese little affectations charming, Virginie had such grace; happily she\ndidn't look like her father or her mother; but whom did she look like?\n\nDuring this sitting there were little skirmishes between the family\nand the painter, who had the audacity to call pere Vervelle witty. This\nflattery brought the family on the double-quick to the heart of the\nartist; he gave a drawing to the daughter, and a sketch to the mother.\n\n\"What! for nothing?\" they said.\n\nPierre Grassou could not help smiling.\n\n\"You shouldn't give away your pictures in that way; they are money,\"\nsaid old Vervelle.\n\nAt the third sitting pere Vervelle mentioned a fine gallery of pictures\nwhich he had in his country-house at Ville d'Avray--Rubens, Gerard Douw,\nMieris, Terburg, Rembrandt, Titian, Paul Potter, etc.\n\n\"Monsieur Vervelle has been very extravagant,\" said Madame Vervelle,\nostentatiously. \"He has over one hundred thousand francs' worth of\npictures.\"\n\n\"I love Art,\" said the former bottle-dealer.\n\nWhen Madame Vervelle's portrait was begun that of her husband was nearly\nfinished, and the enthusiasm of the family knew no bounds. The notary\nhad spoken in the highest praise of the painter. Pierre Grassou was, he\nsaid, one of the most honest fellows on earth; he had laid by thirty-six\nthousand francs; his days of poverty were over; he now saved about ten\nthousand francs a year and capitalized the interest; in short, he was\nincapable of making a woman unhappy. This last remark had enormous\nweight in the scales. Vervelle's friends now heard of nothing but the\ncelebrated painter Fougeres.\n\nThe day on which Fougeres began the portrait of Mademoiselle Virginie,\nhe was virtually son-in-law to the Vervelle family. The three Vervelles\nbloomed out in this studio, which they were now accustomed to consider\nas one of their residences; there was to them an inexplicable attraction\nin this clean, neat, pretty, and artistic abode. Abyssus abyssum, the\ncommonplace attracts the commonplace. Toward the end of the sitting the\nstairway shook, the door was violently thrust open by Joseph Bridau; he\ncame like a whirlwind, his hair flying. He showed his grand haggard face\nas he looked about him, casting everywhere the lightning of his glance;\nthen he walked round the whole studio, and returned abruptly to Grassou,\npulling his coat together over the gastric region, and endeavouring, but\nin vain, to button it, the button mould having escaped from its capsule\nof cloth.\n\n\"Wood is dear,\" he said to Grassou.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"The British are after me\" (slang term for creditors) \"Gracious! do you\npaint such things as that?\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\"\n\n\"Ah! to be sure, yes.\"\n\nThe Vervelle family, extremely shocked by this extraordinary apparition,\npassed from its ordinary red to a cherry-red, two shades deeper.\n\n\"Brings in, hey?\" continued Joseph. \"Any shot in your locker?\"\n\n\"How much do you want?\"\n\n\"Five hundred. I've got one of those bull-dog dealers after me, and if\nthe fellow once gets his teeth in he won't let go while there's a bit of\nme left. What a crew!\"\n\n\"I'll write you a line for my notary.\"\n\n\"Have you got a notary?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That explains to me why you still make cheeks with pink tones like a\nperfumer's sign.\"\n\nGrassou could not help coloring, for Virginie was sitting.\n\n\"Take Nature as you find her,\" said the great painter, going on with his\nlecture. \"Mademoiselle is red-haired. Well, is that a sin? All things\nare magnificent in painting. Put some vermillion on your palette, and\nwarm up those cheeks; touch in those little brown spots; come, butter it\nwell in. Do you pretend to have more sense than Nature?\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Fougeres, \"take my place while I go and write that\nnote.\"\n\nVervelle rolled to the table and whispered in Grassou's ear:--\n\n\"Won't that country lout spoilt it?\"\n\n\"If he would only paint the portrait of your Virginie it would be worth\na thousand times more than mine,\" replied Fougeres, vehemently.\n\nHearing that reply the bourgeois beat a quiet retreat to his wife, who\nwas stupefied by the invasion of this ferocious animal, and very uneasy\nat his co-operation in her daughter's portrait.\n\n\"Here, follow these indications,\" said Bridau, returning the palette,\nand taking the note. \"I won't thank you. I can go back now to d'Arthez'\nchateau, where I am doing a dining-room, and Leon de Lora the tops of\nthe doors--masterpieces! Come and see us.\"\n\nAnd off he went without taking leave, having had enough of looking at\nVirginie.\n\n\"Who is that man?\" asked Madame Vervelle.\n\n\"A great artist,\" answered Grassou.\n\nThere was silence for a moment.\n\n\"Are you quite sure,\" said Virginie, \"that he has done no harm to my\nportrait? He frightened me.\"\n\n\"He has only done it good,\" replied Grassou.\n\n\"Well, if he is a great artist, I prefer a great artist like you,\" said\nMadame Vervelle.\n\nThe ways of genius had ruffled up these orderly bourgeois.\n\nThe phase of autumn so pleasantly named \"Saint Martin's summer\" was\njust beginning. With the timidity of a neophyte in presence of a man of\ngenius, Vervelle risked giving Fougeres an invitation to come out to\nhis country-house on the following Sunday. He knew, he said, how little\nattraction a plain bourgeois family could offer to an artist.\n\n\"You artists,\" he continued, \"want emotions, great scenes, and witty\ntalk; but you'll find good wines, and I rely on my collection of\npictures to compensate an artist like you for the bore of dining with\nmere merchants.\"\n\nThis form of idolatry, which stroked his innocent self-love, was\ncharming to our poor Pierre Grassou, so little accustomed to such\ncompliments. The honest artist, that atrocious mediocrity, that heart\nof gold, that loyal soul, that stupid draughtsman, that worthy fellow,\ndecorated by royalty itself with the Legion of honor, put himself under\narms to go out to Ville d'Avray and enjoy the last fine days of the\nyear. The painter went modestly by public conveyance, and he could not\nbut admire the beautiful villa of the bottle-dealer, standing in a park\nof five acres at the summit of Ville d'Avray, commanding a noble view\nof the landscape. Marry Virginie, and have that beautiful villa some day\nfor his own!\n\nHe was received by the Vervelles with an enthusiasm, a joy, a\nkindliness, a frank bourgeois absurdity which confounded him. It was\nindeed a day of triumph. The prospective son-in-law was marched about\nthe grounds on the nankeen-colored paths, all raked as they should be\nfor the steps of so great a man. The trees themselves looked brushed and\ncombed, and the lawns had just been mown. The pure country air wafted\nto the nostrils a most enticing smell of cooking. All things about the\nmansion seemed to say:\n\n\"We have a great artist among us.\"\n\nLittle old Vervelle himself rolled like an apple through his park, the\ndaughter meandered like an eel, the mother followed with dignified step.\nThese three beings never let go for one moment of Pierre Grassou\nfor seven hours. After dinner, the length of which equalled its\nmagnificence, Monsieur and Madame Vervelle reached the moment of their\ngrand theatrical effect,--the opening of the picture gallery illuminated\nby lamps, the reflections of which were managed with the utmost care.\nThree neighbours, also retired merchants, an old uncle (from whom were\nexpectations), an elderly Demoiselle Vervelle, and a number of other\nguests invited to be present at this ovation to a great artist followed\nGrassou into the picture gallery, all curious to hear his opinion of the\nfamous collection of pere Vervelle, who was fond of oppressing them with\nthe fabulous value of his paintings. The bottle-merchant seemed to have\nthe idea of competing with King Louis-Philippe and the galleries of\nVersailles.\n\nThe pictures, magnificently framed, each bore labels on which was read\nin black letters on a gold ground:\n\n               Rubens\n     Dance of fauns and nymphs\n\n                         Rembrandt\n     Interior of a dissecting room. The physician van Tromp\n             instructing his pupils.\n\nIn all, there were one hundred and fifty pictures, varnished and dusted.\nSome were covered with green baize curtains which were not undrawn in\npresence of young ladies.\n\nPierre Grassou stood with arms pendent, gaping mouth, and no word upon\nhis lips as he recognized half his own pictures in these works of art.\nHe was Rubens, he was Rembrandt, Mieris, Metzu, Paul Potter, Gerard\nDouw! He was twenty great masters all by himself.\n\n\"What is the matter? You've turned pale!\"\n\n\"Daughter, a glass of water! quick!\" cried Madame Vervelle. The painter\ntook pere Vervelle by the button of his coat and led him to a corner on\npretence of looking at a Murillo. Spanish pictures were then the rage.\n\n\"You bought your pictures from Elie Magus?\"\n\n\"Yes, all originals.\"\n\n\"Between ourselves, tell me what he made you pay for those I shall point\nout to you.\"\n\nTogether they walked round the gallery. The guests were amazed at the\ngravity in which the artist proceeded, in company with the host, to\nexamine each picture.\n\n\"Three thousand francs,\" said Vervelle in a whisper, as they reached the\nlast, \"but I tell everybody forty thousand.\"\n\n\"Forty thousand for a Titian!\" said the artist, aloud. \"Why, it is\nnothing at all!\"\n\n\"Didn't I tell you,\" said Vervelle, \"that I had three hundred thousand\nfrancs' worth of pictures?\"\n\n\"I painted those pictures,\" said Pierre Grassou in Vervelle's ear, \"and\nI sold them one by one to Elie Magus for less than ten thousand francs\nthe whole lot.\"\n\n\"Prove it to me,\" said the bottle-dealer, \"and I double my daughter's\n'dot,' for if it is so, you are Rubens, Rembrandt, Titian, Gerard Douw!\"\n\n\"And Magus is a famous picture-dealer!\" said the painter, who now saw\nthe meaning of the misty and aged look imparted to his pictures in\nElie's shop, and the utility of the subjects the picture-dealer had\nrequired of him.\n\nFar from losing the esteem of his admiring bottle-merchant, Monsieur\nde Fougeres (for so the family persisted in calling Pierre Grassou)\nadvanced so much that when the portraits were finished he presented them\ngratuitously to his father-in-law, his mother-in-law and his wife.\n\nAt the present day, Pierre Grassou, who never misses exhibiting at the\nSalon, passes in bourgeois regions for a fine portrait-painter. He earns\nsome twenty thousand francs a year and spoils a thousand francs' worth\nof canvas. His wife has six thousand francs a year in dowry, and he\nlives with his father-in-law. The Vervelles and the Grassous, who agree\ndelightfully, keep a carriage, and are the happiest people on earth.\nPierre Grassou never emerges from the bourgeois circle, in which he\nis considered one of the greatest artists of the period. Not a family\nportrait is painted between the barrier du Trone and the rue du Temple\nthat is not done by this great painter; none of them costs less than\nfive hundred francs. The great reason which the bourgeois families have\nfor employing him is this:--\n\n\"Say what you will of him, he lays by twenty thousand francs a year with\nhis notary.\"\n\nAs Grassou took a creditable part on the occasion of the riots of May\n12th he was appointed an officer of the Legion of honor. He is a major\nin the National Guard. The Museum of Versailles felt it incumbent to\norder a battle-piece of so excellent a citizen, who thereupon walked\nabout Paris to meet his old comrades and have the happiness of saying to\nthem:--\n\n\"The King has given me an order for the Museum of Versailles.\"\n\nMadame de Fougeres adores her husband, to whom she has presented two\nchildren. This painter, a good father and a good husband, is unable to\neradicate from his heart a fatal thought, namely, that artists laugh at\nhis work; that his name is a term of contempt in the studios; and that\nthe feuilletons take no notice of his pictures. But he still works on;\nhe aims for the Academy, where, undoubtedly, he will enter. And--oh!\nvengeance which dilates his heart!--he buys the pictures of celebrated\nartists who are pinched for means, and he substitutes these true works\nof arts that are not his own for the wretched daubs in the collection at\nVille d'Avray.\n\nThere are many mediocrities more aggressive and more mischievous than\nthat of Pierre Grassou, who is, moreover, anonymously benevolent and\ntruly obliging.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\n     Bridau, Joseph\n       The Purse\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       A Start in Life\n       Modeste Mignon\n       Another Study of Woman\n       Letters of Two Brides\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Member for Arcis\n\n     Cardot (Parisian notary)\n       The Muse of the Department\n       A Man of Business\n       Jealousies of a Country Town\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Grassou, Pierre\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Lora, Leon de\n       The Unconscious Humorists\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Start in Life\n       Honorine\n       Cousin Betty\n       Beatrix\n\n     Magus, Elie\n       The Vendetta\n       A Marriage Settlement\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Schinner, Hippolyte\n       The Purse\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Start in Life\n       Albert Savarus\n       The Government Clerks\n       Modeste Mignon\n       The Imaginary Mistress\n       The Unconscious Humorists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pierre Grassou, by Honore de Balzac",
