MOPE, AT BANGOR,\nMAINE.\n\nSeptember 5th, 1879.\n\nMy dear mother--I have kept you posted as far as Tuesday week last, and,\nalthough my letter will not have reached you yet, I will begin another\nbefore my news accumulates too much.  I am glad you show my letters round\nin the family, for I like them all to know what I am doing, and I can't\nwrite to every one, though I try to answer all reasonable expectations.\nBut there are a great many unreasonable ones, as I suppose you know--not\nyours, dear mother, for I am bound to say that you never required of me\nmore than was natural.  You see you are reaping your reward: I write to\nyou before I write to any one else.\n\nThere is one thing, I hope--that you don't show any of my letters to\nWilliam Platt.  If he wants to see any of my letters, he knows the right\nway to go to work.  I wouldn't have him see one of these letters, written\nfor circulation in the family, for anything in the world.  If he wants\none for himself, he has got to write to me first.  Let him write to me\nfirst, and then I will see about answering him.  You can show him this if\nyou like; but if you show him anything more, I will never write to you\nagain.\n\nI told you in my last about my farewell to England, my crossing the\nChannel, and my first impressions of Paris.  I have thought a great deal\nabout that lovely England since I left it, and all the famous historic\nscenes I visited; but I have come to the conclusion that it is not a\ncountry in which I should care to reside.  The position of woman does not\nseem to me at all satisfactory, and that is a point, you know, on which I\nfeel very strongly.  It seems to me that in England they play a very\nfaded-out part, and those with whom I conversed had a kind of depressed\nand humiliated tone; a little dull, tame look, as if they were used to\nbeing snubbed and bullied, which made me want to give them a good\nshaking.  There are a great many people--and a great many things,\ntoo--over here that I should like to perform that operation upon.  I\nshould like to shake the starch out of some of them, and the dust out of\nthe others.  I know fifty girls in Bangor that come much more up to my\nnotion of the stand a truly noble woman should take, than those young\nladies in England.  But they had a most lovely way of speaking (in\nEngland), and the men are _remarkably handsome_.  (You can show this to\nWilliam Platt, if you like.)\n\nI gave you my first impressions of Paris, which quite came up to my\nexpectations, much as I had heard and read about it.  The objects of\ninterest are extremely numerous, and the climate is remarkably cheerful\nand sunny.  I should say the position of woman here was considerably\nhigher, though by no means coming up to the American standard.  The\nmanners of the people are in some respects extremely peculiar, and I feel\nat last that I am indeed in _foreign parts_.  It is, however, a truly\nelegant city (very superior to New York), and I have spent a great deal\nof time in visiting the various monuments and palaces.  I won't give you\nan account of all my wanderings, though I have been most indefatigable;\nfor I am keeping, as I told you before, a most _exhaustive_ journal,\nwhich I will allow you the _privilege_ of reading on my return to Bangor.\nI am getting on remarkably well, and I must say I am sometimes surprised\nat my universal good fortune.  It only shows what a little energy and\ncommon-sense will accomplish.  I have discovered none of these objections\nto a young lady travelling in Europe by herself of which we heard so much\nbefore I left, and I don't expect I ever shall, for I certainly don't\nmean to look for them.  I know what I want, and I always manage to get\nit.\n\nI have received a great deal of politeness--some of it really most\npressing, and I have experienced no drawbacks whatever.  I have made a\ngreat many pleasant acquaintances in travelling round (both ladies and\ngentlemen), and had a great many most interesting talks.  I have\ncollected a great deal of information, for which I refer you to my\njournal.  I assure you my journal is going to be a splendid thing.  I do\njust exactly as I do in Bangor, and I find I do perfectly right; and at\nany rate, I don't care if I don't.  I didn't come to Europe to lead a\nmerely conventional life; I could do that at Bangor.  You know I never\n_would_ do it at Bangor, so it isn't likely I am going to make myself\nmiserable over here.  So long as I accomplish what I desire, and make my\nmoney hold out, I shall regard the thing as a success.  Sometimes I feel\nrather lonely, especially in the evening; but I generally manage to\ninterest myself in something or in some one.  In the evening I usually\nread up about the objects of interest I have visited during the day, or I\npost up my journal.  Sometimes I go to the theatre; or else I play the\npiano in the public parlour.  The public parlour at the hotel isn't much;\nbut the piano is better than that fearful old thing at the Sebago House.\nSometimes I go downstairs and talk to the lady who keeps the books--a\nFrench lady, who is remarkably polite.  She is very pretty, and always\nwears a black dress, with the most beautiful fit; she speaks a little\nEnglish; she tells me she had to learn it in order to converse with the\nAmericans who come in such numbers to this hotel.  She has given me a\ngreat deal of information about the position of woman in France, and much\nof it is very encouraging.  But she has told me at the same time some\nthings that I should not like to write to you (I am hesitating even about\nputting them into my journal), especially if my letters are to be handed\nround in the family.  I assure you they appear to talk about things here\nthat we never think of mentioning at Bangor, or even of thinking about.\nShe seems to think she can tell me everything, because I told her I was\ntravelling for general culture.  Well, I _do_ want to know so much that\nit seems sometimes as if I wanted to know everything; and yet there are\nsome things that I think I don't want to know.  But, as a general thing,\neverything is intensely interesting; I don't mean only everything that\nthis French lady tells me, but everything I see and hear for myself.  I\nfeel really as if I should gain all I desire.\n\nI meet a great many Americans, who, as a general thing, I must say, are\nnot as polite to me as the people over here.  The people over\nhere--especially the gentlemen--are much more what I should call\n_attentive_.  I don't know whether Americans are more _sincere_; I\nhaven't yet made up my mind about that.  The only drawback I experience\nis when Americans sometimes express surprise that I should be travelling\nround alone; so you see it doesn't come from Europeans.  I always have my\nanswer ready; \"For general culture, to acquire the languages, and to see\nEurope for myself;\" and that generally seems to satisfy them.  Dear\nmother, my money holds out very well, and it _is_ real interesting.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nFROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.\n\nSeptember 16th.\n\nSince I last wrote to you I have left that hotel, and come to live in a\nFrench family.  It's a kind of boarding-house combined with a kind of\nschool; only it's not like an American hoarding-house, nor like an\nAmerican school either.  There are four or five people here that have\ncome to learn the language--not to take lessons, but to have an\nopportunity for conversation.  I was very glad to come to such a place,\nfor I had begun to realise that I was not making much progress with the\nFrench.  It seemed to me that I should feel ashamed to have spent two\nmonths in Paris, and not to have acquired more insight into the language.\nI had always heard so much of French conversation, and I found I was\nhaving no more opportunity to practise it than if I had remained at\nBangor.  In fact, I used to hear a great deal more at Bangor, from those\nFrench Canadians that came down to cut the ice, than I saw I should ever\nhear at that hotel.  The lady that kept the books seemed to want so much\nto talk to me in English (for the sake of practice, too, I suppose), that\nI couldn't bear to let her know I didn't like it.  The chambermaid was\nIrish, and all the waiters were German, so that I never heard a word of\nFrench spoken.  I suppose you might hear a great deal in the shops; only,\nas I don't buy anything--I prefer to spend my money for purposes of\nculture--I don't have that advantage.\n\nI have been thinking some of taking a teacher, but I am well acquainted\nwith the grammar already, and teachers always keep you bothering over the\nverbs.  I was a good deal troubled, for I felt as if I didn't want to go\naway without having, at least, got a general idea of French conversation.\nThe theatre gives you a good deal of insight, and as I told you in my\nlast, I go a good deal to places of amusement.  I find no difficulty\nwhatever in going to such places alone, and am always treated with the\npoliteness which, as I told you before, I encounter everywhere.  I see\nplenty of other ladies alone (mostly French), and they generally seem to\nbe enjoying themselves as much as I.  But at the theatre every one talks\nso fast that I can scarcely make out what they say; and, besides, there\nare a great many vulgar expressions which it is unnecessary to learn.  But\nit was the theatre, nevertheless, that put me on the track.  The very\nnext day after I wrote to you last I went to the Palais Royal, which is\none of the principal theatres in Paris.  It is very small, but it is very\ncelebrated, and in my guide-book it is marked with _two stars_, which is\na sign of importance attached only to _first-class_ objects of interest.\nBut after I had been there half an hour I found I couldn't understand a\nsingle word of the play, they gabbled it off so fast, and they made use\nof such peculiar expressions.  I felt a good deal disappointed and\ntroubled--I was afraid I shouldn't gain all I had come for.  But while I\nwas thinking it over--thinking what I _should_ do--I heard two gentlemen\ntalking behind me.  It was between the acts, and I couldn't help\nlistening to what they said.  They were talking English, but I guess they\nwere Americans.\n\n\"Well,\" said one of them, \"it all depends on what you are after.  I'm\nFrench; that's what I'm after.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the other, \"I'm after Art.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the first, \"I'm after Art too; but I'm after French most.\"\n\nThen, dear mother, I am sorry to say the second one swore a little.  He\nsaid, \"Oh, damn French!\"\n\n\"No, I won't damn French,\" said his friend.  \"I'll acquire it--that's\nwhat I'll do with it.  I'll go right into a family.\"\n\n\"What family'll you go into?\"\n\n\"Into some French family.  That's the only way to do--to go to some place\nwhere you can talk.  If you're after Art, you want to stick to the\ngalleries; you want to go right through the Louvre, room by room; you\nwant to take a room a day, or something of that sort.  But, if you want\nto acquire French, the thing is to look out for a family.  There are lots\nof French families here that take you to board and teach you.  My second\ncousin--that young lady I told you about--she got in with a crowd like\nthat, and they booked her right up in three months.  They just took her\nright in and they talked to her.  That's what they do to you; they set\nyou right down and they talk _at_ you.  You've got to understand them;\nyou can't help yourself.  That family my cousin was with has moved away\nsomewhere, or I should try and get in with them.  They were very smart\npeople, that family; after she left, my cousin corresponded with them in\nFrench.  But I mean to find some other crowd, if it takes a lot of\ntrouble!\"\n\nI listened to all this with great interest, and when he spoke about his\ncousin I was on the point of turning around to ask him the address of the\nfamily that she was with; but the next moment he said they had moved\naway; so I sat still.  The other gentleman, however, didn't seem to be\naffected in the same way as I was.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"you may follow up that if you like; I mean to follow up\nthe pictures.  I don't believe there is ever going to be any considerable\ndemand in the United States for French; but I can promise you that in\nabout ten years there'll be a big demand for Art!  And it won't be\ntemporary either.\"\n\nThat remark may be very true, but I don't care anything about the demand;\nI want to know French for its own sake.  I don't want to think I have\nbeen all this while without having gained an insight . . . The very next\nday, I asked the lady who kept the books at the hotel whether she knew of\nany family that could take me to board and give me the benefit of their\nconversation.  She instantly threw up her hands, with several little\nshrill cries (in their French way, you know), and told me that her\ndearest friend kept a regular place of that kind.  If she had known I was\nlooking out for such a place she would have told me before; she had not\nspoken of it herself, because she didn't wish to injure the hotel by\nbeing the cause of my going away.  She told me this was a charming\nfamily, who had often received American ladies (and others as well) who\nwished to follow up the language, and she was sure I should be delighted\nwith them.  So she gave me their address, and offered to go with me to\nintroduce me.  But I was in such a hurry that I went off by myself; and I\nhad no trouble in finding these good people.  They were delighted to\nreceive me, and I was very much pleased with what I saw of them.  They\nseemed to have plenty of conversation, and there will be no trouble about\nthat.\n\nI came here to stay about three days ago, and by this time I have seen a\ngreat deal of them.  The price of board struck me as rather high; but I\nmust remember that a quantity of conversation is thrown in.  I have a\nvery pretty little room--without any carpet, but with seven mirrors, two\nclocks, and five curtains.  I was rather disappointed after I arrived to\nfind that there are several other Americans here for the same purpose as\nmyself.  At least there are three Americans and two English people; and\nalso a German gentleman.  I am afraid, therefore, our conversation will\nbe rather mixed, but I have not yet time to judge.  I try to talk with\nMadame de Maisonrouge all I can (she is the lady of the house, and the\n_real_ family consists only of herself and her two daughters).  They are\nall most elegant, interesting women, and I am sure we shall become\nintimate friends.  I will write you more about them in my next.  Tell\nWilliam Platt I don't care what he does.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nFROM MISS VIOLET RAY, IN PARIS, TO MISS AGNES RICH, IN NEW YORK.\n\nSeptember 21st.\n\nWe had hardly got here when father received a telegram saying he would\nhave to come right back to New York.  It was for something about his\nbusiness--I don't know exactly what; you know I never understand those\nthings, never want to.  We had just got settled at the hotel, in some\ncharming rooms, and mother and I, as you may imagine, were greatly\nannoyed.  Father is extremely fussy, as you know, and his first idea, as\nsoon as he found he should have to go back, was that we should go back\nwith him.  He declared he would never leave us in Paris alone, and that\nwe must return and come out again.  I don't know what he thought would\nhappen to us; I suppose he thought we should be too extravagant.  It's\nfather's theory that we are always running up bills, whereas a little\nobservation would show him that we wear the same old _rags_ FOR MONTHS.\nBut father has no observation; he has nothing but theories.  Mother and\nI, however, have, fortunately, a great deal of _practice_, and we\nsucceeded in making him understand that we wouldn't budge from Paris, and\nthat we would rather be chopped into small pieces than cross that\ndreadful ocean again.  So, at last, he decided to go back alone, and to\nleave us here for three months.  But, to show you how fussy he is, he\nrefused to let us stay at the hotel, and insisted that we should go into\na _family_.  I don't know what put such an idea into his head, unless it\nwas some advertisement that he saw in one of the American papers that are\npublished here.\n\nThere are families here who receive American and English people to live\nwith them, under the pretence of teaching them French.  You may imagine\nwhat people they are--I mean the families themselves.  But the Americans\nwho choose this peculiar manner of seeing Paris must be actually just as\nbad.  Mother and I were horrified, and declared that main force should\nnot remove us from the hotel.  But father has a way of arriving at his\nends which is more efficient than violence.  He worries and fusses; he\n\"nags,\" as we used to say at school; and, when mother and I are quite\nworn out, his triumph is assured.  Mother is usually worn out more easily\nthan I, and she ends by siding with father; so that, at last, when they\ncombine their forces against poor little me, I have to succumb.  You\nshould have heard the way father went on about this \"family\" plan; he\ntalked to every one he saw about it; he used to go round to the banker's\nand talk to the people there--the people in the post-office; he used to\ntry and exchange ideas about it with the waiters at the hotel.  He said\nit would be more safe, more respectable, more economical; that I should\nperfect my French; that mother would learn how a French household is\nconducted; that he should feel more easy, and five hundred reasons more.\nThey were none of them good, but that made no difference.  It's all\nhumbug, his talking about economy, when every one knows that business in\nAmerica has completely recovered, that the prostration is all over, and\nthat immense fortunes are being made.  We have been economising for the\nlast five years, and I supposed we came abroad to reap the benefits of\nit.\n\nAs for my French, it is quite as perfect as I want it to be.  (I assure\nyou I am often surprised at my own fluency, and, when I get a little more\npractice in the genders and the idioms, I shall do very well in this\nrespect.)  To make a long story short, however, father carried his point,\nas usual; mother basely deserted me at the last moment, and, after\nholding out alone for three days, I told them to do with me what they\npleased!  Father lost three steamers in succession by remaining in Paris\nto argue with me.  You know he is like the schoolmaster in Goldsmith's\n\"Deserted Village\"--\"e'en though vanquished, he would argue still.\" He\nand mother went to look at some seventeen families (they had got the\naddresses somewhere), while I retired to my sofa, and would have nothing\nto do with it.  At last they made arrangements, and I was transported to\nthe establishment from which I now write you.  I write you from the bosom\nof a Parisian menage--from the depths of a second-rate boarding-house.\n\nFather only left Paris after he had seen us what he calls comfortably\nsettled here, and had informed Madame de Maisonrouge (the mistress of the\nestablishment--the head of the \"family\") that he wished my French\npronunciation especially attended to.  The pronunciation, as it happens,\nis just what I am most at home in; if he had said my genders or my idioms\nthere would have been some sense.  But poor father has no tact, and this\ndefect is especially marked since he has been in Europe.  He will be\nabsent, however, for three months, and mother and I shall breathe more\nfreely; the situation will be less intense.  I must confess that we\nbreathe more freely than I expected, in this place, where we have been\nfor about a week.  I was sure, before we came, that it would prove to be\nan establishment of the _lowest description_; but I must say that, in\nthis respect, I am agreeably disappointed.  The French are so clever that\nthey know even how to manage a place of this kind.  Of course it is very\ndisagreeable to live with strangers, but as, after all, if I were not\nstaying with Madame de Maisonrouge I should not be living in the Faubourg\nSt. Germain, I don't know that from the point of view of exclusiveness it\nis any great loss to be here.\n\nOur rooms are very prettily arranged, and the table is remarkably good.\nMamma thinks the whole thing--the place and the people, the manners and\ncustoms--very amusing; but mamma is very easily amused.  As for me, you\nknow, all that I ask is to be let alone, and not to have people's society\nforced upon me.  I have never wanted for society of my own choosing, and,\nso long as I retain possession of my faculties, I don't suppose I ever\nshall.  As I said, however, the place is very well managed, and I succeed\nin doing as I please, which, you know, is my most cherished pursuit.\nMadame de Maisonrouge has a great deal of tact--much more than poor\nfather.  She is what they call here a belle femme, which means that she\nis a tall, ugly woman, with style.  She dresses very well, and has a\ngreat deal of talk; but, though she is a very good imitation of a lady, I\nnever see her behind the dinner-table, in the evening, smiling and\nbowing, as the people come in, and looking all the while at the dishes\nand the servants, without thinking of a _dame de comptoir_ blooming in a\ncorner of a shop or a restaurant.  I am sure that, in spite of her fine\nname, she was once a _dame de comptoir_.  I am also sure that, in spite\nof her smiles and the pretty things she says to every one, she hates us\nall, and would like to murder us.  She is a hard, clever Frenchwoman, who\nwould like to amuse herself and enjoy her Paris, and she must be bored to\ndeath at passing all her time in the midst of stupid English people who\nmumble broken French at her.  Some day she will poison the soup or the\n_vin rouge_; but I hope that will not be until after mother and I shall\nhave left her.  She has two daughters, who, except that one is decidedly\npretty, are meagre imitations of herself.\n\nThe \"family,\" for the rest, consists altogether of our beloved\ncompatriots, and of still more beloved Englanders.  There is an\nEnglishman here, with his sister, and they seem to be rather nice people.\nHe is remarkably handsome, but excessively affected and patronising,\nespecially to us Americans; and I hope to have a chance of biting his\nhead off before long.  The sister is very pretty, and, apparently, very\nnice; but, in costume, she is Britannia incarnate.  There is a very\npleasant little Frenchman--when they are nice they are charming--and a\nGerman doctor, a big blonde man, who looks like a great white bull; and\ntwo Americans, besides mother and me.  One of them is a young man from\nBoston,--an aesthetic young man, who talks about its being \"a real Corot\nday,\" etc., and a young woman--a girl, a female, I don't know what to\ncall her--from Vermont, or Minnesota, or some such place.  This young\nwoman is the most extraordinary specimen of artless Yankeeism that I ever\nencountered; she is really too horrible.  I have been three times to\nClementine about your underskirt, etc.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nFROM LOUIS LEVERETT, IN PARIS, TO HARVARD TREMONT, IN BOSTON.\n\nSeptember 25th.\n\nMy dear Harvard--I have carried out my plan, of which I gave you a hint\nin my last, and I only regret that I should not have done it before.  It\nis human nature, after all, that is the most interesting thing in the\nworld, and it only reveals itself to the truly earnest seeker.  There is\na want of earnestness in that life of hotels and railroad trains, which\nso many of our countrymen are content to lead in this strange Old World,\nand I was distressed to find how far I, myself; had been led along the\ndusty, beaten track.  I had, however, constantly wanted to turn aside\ninto more unfrequented ways; to plunge beneath the surface and see what I\nshould discover.  But the opportunity had always been missing; somehow, I\nnever meet those opportunities that we hear about and read about--the\nthings that happen to people in novels and biographies.  And yet I am\nalways on the watch to take advantage of any opening that may present\nitself; I am always looking out for experiences, for sensations--I might\nalmost say for adventures.\n\nThe great thing is to _live_, you know--to feel, to be conscious of one's\npossibilities; not to pass through life mechanically and insensibly, like\na letter through the post-office.  There are times, my dear Harvard, when\nI feel as if I were really capable of everything--capable _de tout_, as\nthey say here--of the greatest excesses as well as the greatest heroism.\nOh, to be able to say that one has lived--_qu'on a vecu_, as they say\nhere--that idea exercises an indefinable attraction for me.  You will,\nperhaps, reply, it is easy to say it; but the thing is to make people\nbelieve you!  And, then, I don't want any second-hand, spurious\nsensations; I want the knowledge that leaves a trace--that leaves strange\nscars and stains and reveries behind it!  But I am afraid I shock you,\nperhaps even frighten you.\n\nIf you repeat my remarks to any of the West Cedar Street circle, be sure\nyou tone them down as your discretion will suggest.  For yourself; you\nwill know that I have always had an intense desire to see something of\n_real French life_.  You are acquainted with my great sympathy with the\nFrench; with my natural tendency to enter into the French way of looking\nat life.  I sympathise with the artistic temperament; I remember you used\nsometimes to hint to me that you thought my own temperament too artistic.\nI don't think that in Boston there is any real sympathy with the artistic\ntemperament; we tend to make everything a matter of right and wrong.  And\nin Boston one can't _live--on ne peut pas vivre_, as they say here.  I\ndon't mean one can't reside--for a great many people manage that; but one\ncan't live aesthetically--I may almost venture to say, sensuously.  This\nis why I have always been so much drawn to the French, who are so\naesthetic, so sensuous.  I am so sorry that Theophile Gautier has passed\naway; I should have liked so much to go and see him, and tell him all\nthat I owe him.  He was living when I was here before; but, you know, at\nthat time I was travelling with the Johnsons, who are not aesthetic, and\nwho used to make me feel rather ashamed of my artistic temperament.  If I\nhad gone to see the great apostle of beauty, I should have had to go\nclandestinely--_en cachette_, as they say here; and that is not my\nnature; I like to do everything frankly, freely, _naivement, au grand\njour_.  That is the great thing--to be free, to be frank, to be _naif_.\nDoesn't Matthew Arnold say that somewhere--or is it Swinburne, or Pater?\n\nWhen I was with the Johnsons everything was superficial; and, as regards\nlife, everything was brought down to the question of right and wrong.\nThey were too didactic; art should never be didactic; and what is life\nbut an art?  Pater has said that so well, somewhere.  With the Johnsons I\nam afraid I lost many opportunities; the tone was gray and cottony, I\nmight almost say woolly.  But now, as I tell you, I have determined to\ntake right hold for myself; to look right into European life, and judge\nit without Johnsonian prejudices.  I have taken up my residence in a\nFrench family, in a real Parisian house.  You see I have the courage of\nmy opinions; I don't shrink from carrying out my theory that the great\nthing is to _live_.\n\nYou know I have always been intensely interested in Balzac, who never\nshrank from the reality, and whose almost _lurid_ pictures of Parisian\nlife have often haunted me in my wanderings through the old\nwicked-looking streets on the other side of the river.  I am only sorry\nthat my new friends--my French family--do not live in the old city--_au\ncoeur du vieux Paris_, as they say here.  They live only in the Boulevard\nHaussman, which is less picturesque; but in spite of this they have a\ngreat deal of the Balzac tone.  Madame de Maisonrouge belongs to one of\nthe oldest and proudest families in France; but she has had reverses\nwhich have compelled her to open an establishment in which a limited\nnumber of travellers, who are weary of the beaten track, who have the\nsense of local colour--she explains it herself; she expresses it so\nwell--in short, to open a sort of boarding-house.  I don't see why I\nshould not, after all, use that expression, for it is the correlative of\nthe term _pension bourgeoise_, employed by Balzac in the _Pere Goriot_.\nDo you remember the _pension bourgeoise_ of Madame Vauquer _nee_ de\nConflans?  But this establishment is not at all like that: and indeed it\nis not at all _bourgeois_; there is something distinguished, something\naristocratic, about it.  The Pension Vauquer was dark, brown, sordid,\n_graisseuse_; but this is in quite a different tone, with high, clear,\nlightly-draped windows, tender, subtle, almost morbid, colours, and\nfurniture in elegant, studied, reed-like lines.  Madame de Maisonrouge\nreminds me of Madame Hulot--do you remember \"la belle Madame Hulot?\"--in\n_Les Barents Pauvres_.  She has a great charm; a little artificial, a\nlittle fatigued, with a little suggestion of hidden things in her life;\nbut I have always been sensitive to the charm of fatigue, of duplicity.\n\nI am rather disappointed, I confess, in the society I find here; it is\nnot so local, so characteristic, as I could have desired.  Indeed, to\ntell the truth, it is not local at all; but, on the other hand, it is\ncosmopolitan, and there is a great advantage in that.  We are French, we\nare English, we are American, we are German; and, I believe, there are\nsome Russians and Hungarians expected.  I am much interested in the study\nof national types; in comparing, contrasting, seizing the strong points,\nthe weak points, the point of view of each.  It is interesting to shift\none's point of view--to enter into strange, exotic ways of looking at\nlife.\n\nThe American types here are not, I am sorry to say, so interesting as\nthey might be, and, excepting myself; are exclusively feminine.  We are\n_thin_, my dear Harvard; we are pale, we are sharp.  There is something\nmeagre about us; our line is wanting in roundness, our composition in\nrichness.  We lack temperament; we don't know how to live; _nous ne\nsavons pas vivre_, as they say here.  The American temperament is\nrepresented (putting myself aside, and I often think that my temperament\nis not at all American) by a young girl and her mother, and another young\ngirl without her mother--without her mother or any attendant or appendage\nwhatever.  These young girls are rather curious types; they have a\ncertain interest, they have a certain grace, but they are disappointing\ntoo; they don't go far; they don't keep all they promise; they don't\nsatisfy the imagination.  They are cold, slim, sexless; the physique is\nnot generous, not abundant; it is only the drapery, the skirts and\nfurbelows (that is, I mean in the young lady who has her mother) that are\nabundant.  They are very different: one of them all elegance, all\nexpensiveness, with an air of high fashion, from New York; the other a\nplain, pure, clear-eyed, straight-waisted, straight-stepping maiden from\nthe heart of New England.  And yet they are very much alike too--more\nalike than they would care to think themselves for they eye each other\nwith cold, mistrustful, deprecating looks.  They are both specimens of\nthe emancipated young American girl--practical, positive, passionless,\nsubtle, and knowing, as you please, either too much or too little.  And\nyet, as I say, they have a certain stamp, a certain grace; I like to talk\nwith them, to study them.\n\nThe fair New Yorker is, sometimes, very amusing; she asks me if every one\nin Boston talks like me--if every one is as \"intellectual\" as your poor\ncorrespondent.  She is for ever throwing Boston up at me; I can't get rid\nof Boston.  The other one rubs it into me too; but in a different way;\nshe seems to feel about it as a good Mahommedan feels toward Mecca, and\nregards it as a kind of focus of light for the whole human race.  Poor\nlittle Boston, what nonsense is talked in thy name!  But this New England\nmaiden is, in her way, a strange type: she is travelling all over Europe\nalone--\"to see it,\" she says, \"for herself.\"  For herself!  What can that\nstiff slim self of hers do with such sights, such visions!  She looks at\neverything, goes everywhere, passes her way, with her clear quiet eyes\nwide open; skirting the edge of obscene abysses without suspecting them;\npushing through brambles without tearing her robe; exciting, without\nknowing it, the most injurious suspicions; and always holding her course,\npassionless, stainless, fearless, charmless!  It is a little figure in\nwhich, after all, if you can get the right point of view, there is\nsomething rather striking.\n\nBy way of contrast, there is a lovely English girl, with eyes as shy as\nviolets, and a voice as sweet!  She has a sweet Gainsborough head, and a\ngreat Gainsborough hat, with a mighty plume in front of it, which makes a\nshadow over her quiet English eyes.  Then she has a sage-green robe,\n\"mystic, wonderful,\" all embroidered with subtle devices and flowers, and\nbirds of tender tint; very straight and tight in front, and adorned\nbehind, along the spine, with large, strange, iridescent buttons.  The\nrevival of taste, of the sense of beauty, in England, interests me\ndeeply; what is there in a simple row of spinal buttons to make one\ndream--to _donnor a rever_, as they say here?  I think that a great\naesthetic renascence is at hand, and that a great light will be kindled\nin England, for all the world to see.  There are spirits there that I\nshould like to commune with; I think they would understand me.\n\nThis gracious English maiden, with her clinging robes, her amulets and\ngirdles, with something quaint and angular in her step, her carriage\nsomething mediaeval and Gothic, in the details of her person and dress,\nthis lovely Evelyn Vane (isn't it a beautiful name?) is deeply,\ndelightfully picturesque.  She is much a woman--elle _est bien femme_, as\nthey say here; simpler, softer, rounder, richer than the young girls I\nspoke of just now.  Not much talk--a great, sweet silence.  Then the\nviolet eye--the very eye itself seems to blush; the great shadowy hat,\nmaking the brow so quiet; the strange, clinging, clutching, pictured\nraiment!  As I say, it is a very gracious, tender type.  She has her\nbrother with her, who is a beautiful, fair-haired, gray-eyed young\nEnglishman.  He is purely objective; and he, too, is very plastic.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nFROM MIRANDA HOPE TO HER MOTHER.\n\nSeptember 26th.\n\nYou must not be frightened at not hearing from me oftener; it is not\nbecause I am in any trouble, but because I am getting on so well.  If I\nwere in any trouble I don't think I should write to you; I should just\nkeep quiet and see it through myself.  But that is not the case at\npresent and, if I don't write to you, it is because I am so deeply\ninterested over here that I don't seem to find time.  It was a real\nprovidence that brought me to this house, where, in spite of all\nobstacles, I am able to do much good work.  I wonder how I find the time\nfor all I do; but when I think that I have only got a year in Europe, I\nfeel as if I wouldn't sacrifice a single hour.\n\nThe obstacles I refer to are the disadvantages I have in learning French,\nthere being so many persons around me speaking English, and that, as you\nmay say, in the very bosom of a French family.  It seems as if you heard\nEnglish everywhere; but I certainly didn't expect to find it in a place\nlike this.  I am not discouraged, however, and I talk French all I can,\neven with the other English boarders.  Then I have a lesson every day\nfrom Miss Maisonrouge (the elder daughter of the lady of the house), and\nFrench conversation every evening in the salon, from eight to eleven,\nwith Madame herself, and some friends of hers that often come in.  Her\ncousin, Mr. Verdier, a young French gentleman, is fortunately staying\nwith her, and I make a point of talking with him as much as possible.  I\nhave _extra private lessons_ from him, and I often go out to walk with\nhim.  Some night, soon, he is to accompany me to the opera.  We have also\na most interesting plan of visiting all the galleries in Paris together.\nLike most of the French, he converses with great fluency, and I feel as\nif I should really gain from him.  He is remarkably handsome, and\nextremely polite--paying a great many compliments, which, I am afraid,\nare not always _sincere_.  When I return to Bangor I will tell you some\nof the things he has said to me.  I think you will consider them\nextremely curious, and very beautiful _in their way_.\n\nThe conversation in the parlour (from eight to eleven) is often\nremarkably brilliant, and I often wish that you, or some of the Bangor\nfolks, could be there to enjoy it.  Even though you couldn't understand\nit I think you would like to hear the way they go on; they seem to\nexpress so much.  I sometimes think that at Bangor they don't express\nenough (but it seems as if over there, there was less to express).  It\nseems as if; at Bangor, there were things that folks never _tried_ to\nsay; but here, I have learned from studying French that you have no idea\nwhat you _can_ say, before you try.  At Bangor they seem to give it up\nbeforehand; they don't make any effort.  (I don't say this in the least\nfor William Platt, _in particular_.)\n\nI am sure I don't know what they will think of me when I get back.  It\nseems as if; over here, I had learned to come out with everything.  I\nsuppose they will think I am not sincere; but isn't it more sincere to\ncome out with things than to conceal them?  I have become very good\nfriends with every one in the house--that is (you see, I _am_ sincere),\nwith _almost_ every one.  It is the most interesting circle I ever was\nin.  There's a girl here, an American, that I don't like so much as the\nrest; but that is only because she won't let me.  I should like to like\nher, ever so much, because she is most lovely and most attractive; but\nshe doesn't seem to want to know me or to like me.  She comes from New\nYork, and she is remarkably pretty, with beautiful eyes and the most\ndelicate features; she is also remarkably elegant--in this respect would\nbear comparison with any one I have seen over here.  But it seems as if\nshe didn't want to recognise me or associate with me; as if she wanted to\nmake a difference between us.  It is like people they call \"haughty\" in\nbooks.  I have never seen any one like that before--any one that wanted\nto make a difference; and at first I was right down interested, she\nseemed to me so like a proud young lady in a novel.  I kept saying to\nmyself all day, \"haughty, haughty,\" and I wished she would keep on so.\nBut she did keep on; she kept on too long; and then I began to feel hurt.\nI couldn't think what I have done, and I can't think yet.  It's as if she\nhad got some idea about me, or had heard some one say something.  If some\ngirls should behave like that I shouldn't make any account of it; but\nthis one is so refined, and looks as if she might be so interesting if I\nonce got to know her, that I think about it a good deal.  I am bound to\nfind out what her reason is--for of course she has got some reason; I am\nright down curious to know.\n\nI went up to her to ask her the day before yesterday; I thought that was\nthe best way.  I told her I wanted to know her better, and would like to\ncome and see her in her room--they tell me she has got a lovely room--and\nthat if she had heard anything against me, perhaps she would tell me when\nI came.  But she was more distant than ever, and she just turned it off;\nsaid that she had never heard me mentioned, and that her room was too\nsmall to receive visitors.  I suppose she spoke the truth, but I am sure\nshe has got some reason, all the same.  She has got some idea, and I am\nbound to find out before I go, if I have to ask everybody in the house.  I\n_am_ right down curious.  I wonder if she doesn't think me refined--or if\nshe had ever heard anything against Bangor?  I can't think it is that.\nDon't you remember when Clara Barnard went to visit New York, three years\nago, how much attention she received?  And you know Clara _is_ Bangor, to\nthe soles of her shoes.  Ask William Platt--so long as he isn't a\nnative--if he doesn't consider Clara Barnard refined.\n\nApropos, as they say here, of refinement, there is another American in\nthe house--a gentleman from Boston--who is just crowded with it.  His\nname is Mr. Louis Leverett (such a beautiful name, I think), and he is\nabout thirty years old.  He is rather small, and he looks pretty sick; he\nsuffers from some affection of the liver.  But his conversation is\nremarkably interesting, and I delight to listen to him--he has such\nbeautiful ideas.  I feel as if it were hardly right, not being in French;\nbut, fortunately, he uses a great many French expressions.  It's in a\ndifferent style from the conversation of Mr. Verdier--not so\ncomplimentary, but more intellectual.  He is intensely fond of pictures,\nand has given me a great many ideas about them which I should never have\ngained without him; I shouldn't have known where to look for such ideas.\nHe thinks everything of pictures; he thinks we don't make near enough of\nthem.  They seem to make a good deal of them here; but I couldn't help\ntelling him the other day that in Bangor I really don't think we do.\n\nIf I had any money to spend I would buy some and take them back, to hang\nup.  Mr. Leverett says it would do them good--not the pictures, but the\nBangor folks.  He thinks everything of the French, too, and says we don't\nmake nearly enough of _them_.  I couldn't help telling him the other day\nthat at any rate they make enough of themselves.  But it is very\ninteresting to hear him go on about the French, and it is so much gain to\nme, so long as that is what I came for.  I talk to him as much as I dare\nabout Boston, but I do feel as if this were right down wrong--a stolen\npleasure.\n\nI can get all the Boston culture I want when I go back, if I carry out my\nplan, my happy vision, of going there to reside.  I ought to direct all\nmy efforts to European culture now, and keep Boston to finish off.  But\nit seems as if I couldn't help taking a peep now and then, in\nadvance--with a Bostonian.  I don't know when I may meet one again; but\nif there are many others like Mr. Leverett there, I shall be certain not\nto want when I carry out my dream.  He is just as full of culture as he\ncan live.  But it seems strange how many different sorts there are.\n\nThere are two of the English who I suppose are very cultivated too; but\nit doesn't seem as if I could enter into theirs so easily, though I try\nall I can.  I do love their way of speaking, and sometimes I feel almost\nas if it would be right to give up trying to learn French, and just try\nto learn to speak our own tongue as these English speak it.  It isn't the\nthings they say so much, though these are often rather curious, but it is\nin the way they pronounce, and the sweetness of their voice.  It seems as\nif they must _try_ a good deal to talk like that; but these English that\nare here don't seem to try at all, either to speak or do anything else.\nThey are a young lady and her brother.  I believe they belong to some\nnoble family.  I have had a good deal of intercourse with them, because I\nhave felt more free to talk to them than to the Americans--on account of\nthe language.  It seems as if in talking with them I was almost learning\na new one.\n\nI never supposed, when I left Bangor, that I was coming to Europe to\nlearn _English_!  If I do learn it, I don't think you will understand me\nwhen I get back, and I don't think you'll like it much.  I should be a\ngood deal criticised if I spoke like that at Bangor.  However, I verily\nbelieve Bangor is the most critical place on earth; I have seen nothing\nlike it over here.  Tell them all I have come to the conclusion that they\nare _a great deal too fastidious_.  But I was speaking about this English\nyoung lady and her brother.  I wish I could put them before you.  She is\nlovely to look at; she seems so modest and retiring.  In spite of this,\nhowever, she dresses in a way that attracts great attention, as I\ncouldn't help noticing when one day I went out to walk with her.  She was\never so much looked at; but she didn't seem to notice it, until at last I\ncouldn't help calling attention to it.  Mr. Leverett thinks everything of\nit; he calls it the \"costume of the future.\"  I should call it rather the\ncostume of the past--you know the English have such an attachment to the\npast.  I said this the other day to Madame do Maisonrouge--that Miss Vane\ndressed in the costume of the past.  _De l'an passe, vous voulez dire_?\nsaid Madame, with her little French laugh (you can get William Platt to\ntranslate this, he used to tell me he knew so much French).\n\nYou know I told you, in writing some time ago, that I had tried to get\nsome insight into the position of woman in England, and, being here with\nMiss Vane, it has seemed to me to be a good opportunity to get a little\nmore.  I have asked her a great deal about it; but she doesn't seem able\nto give me much information.  The first time I asked her she told me the\nposition of a lady depended upon the rank of her father, her eldest\nbrother, her husband, etc.  She told me her own position was very good,\nbecause her father was some relation--I forget what--to a lord.  She\nthinks everything of this; and that proves to me that the position of\nwoman in her country cannot be satisfactory; because, if it were, it\nwouldn't depend upon that of your relations, even your nearest.  I don't\nknow much about lords, and it does try my patience (though she is just as\nsweet as she can live) to hear her talk as if it were a matter of course\nthat I should.\n\nI feel as if it were right to ask her as often as I can if she doesn't\nconsider every one equal; but she always says she doesn't, and she\nconfesses that she doesn't think she is equal to \"Lady\nSomething-or-other,\" who is the wife of that relation of her father.  I\ntry and persuade her all I can that she is; but it seems as if she didn't\nwant to be persuaded; and when I ask her if Lady So-and-so is of the same\nopinion (that Miss Vane isn't her equal), she looks so soft and pretty\nwith her eyes, and says, \"Of course she is!\"  When I tell her that this\nis right down bad for Lady So-and-so, it seems as if she wouldn't believe\nme, and the only answer she will make is that Lady So-and-so is\n\"extremely nice.\"  I don't believe she is nice at all; if she were nice,\nshe wouldn't have such ideas as that.  I tell Miss Vane that at Bangor we\nthink such ideas vulgar; but then she looks as though she had never heard\nof Bangor.  I often want to shake her, though she _is_ so sweet.  If she\nisn't angry with the people who make her feel that way, I am angry for\nher.  I am angry with her brother too, for she is evidently very much\nafraid of him, and this gives me some further insight into the subject.\nShe thinks everything of her brother, and thinks it natural that she\nshould be afraid of him, not only physically (for this _is_ natural, as\nhe is enormously tall and strong, and has very big fists), but morally\nand intellectually.  She seems unable, however, to take in any argument,\nand she makes me realise what I have often heard--that if you are timid\nnothing will reason you out of it.\n\nMr. Vane, also (the brother), seems to have the same prejudices, and when\nI tell him, as I often think it right to do, that his sister is not his\nsubordinate, even if she does think so, but his equal, and, perhaps in\nsome respects his superior, and that if my brother, in Bangor, were to\ntreat me as he treates this poor young girl, who has not spirit enough to\nsee the question in its true light, there would be an indignation,\nmeeting of the citizens to protest against such an outrage to the\nsanctity of womanhood--when I tell him all this, at breakfast or dinner,\nhe bursts out laughing so loud that all the plates clatter on the table.\n\nBut at such a time as this there is always one person who seems\ninterested in what I say--a German gentleman, a professor, who sits next\nto me at dinner, and whom I must tell you more about another time.  He is\nvery learned, and has a great desire for information; he appreciates a\ngreat many of my remarks, and after dinner, in the salon, he often comes\nto me to ask me questions about them.  I have to think a little,\nsometimes, to know what I did say, or what I do think.  He takes you\nright up where you left off; and he is almost as fond of discussing\nthings as William Platt is.  He is splendidly educated, in the German\nstyle, and he told me the other day that he was an \"intellectual broom.\"\nWell, if he is, he sweeps clean; I told him that.  After he has been\ntalking to me I feel as if I hadn't got a speck of dust left in my mind\nanywhere.  It's a most delightful feeling.  He says he's an observer; and\nI am sure there is plenty over here to observe.  But I have told you\nenough for to-day.  I don't know how much longer I shall stay here; I am\ngetting on so fast that it sometimes seems as if I shouldn't need all the\ntime I have laid out.  I suppose your cold weather has promptly begun, as\nusual; it sometimes makes me envy you.  The fall weather here is very\ndull and damp, and I feel very much as if I should like to be braced up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nFROM MISS EVELYN VANE, IN PARIS, TO THE LADY AUGUSTA FLEMING, AT\nBRIGHTON.\n\nParis, September 30th.\n\nDear Lady Augusta--I am afraid I shall not be able to come to you on\nJanuary 7th, as you kindly proposed at Homburg.  I am so very, very\nsorry; it is a great disappointment to me.  But I have just heard that it\nhas been settled that mamma and the children are coming abroad for a part\nof the winter, and mamma wishes me to go with them to Hyeres, where\nGeorgina has been ordered for her lungs.  She has not been at all well\nthese three months, and now that the damp weather has begun she is very\npoorly indeed; so that last week papa decided to have a consultation, and\nhe and mamma went with her up to town and saw some three or four doctors.\nThey all of them ordered the south of France, but they didn't agree about\nthe place; so that mamma herself decided for Hyeres, because it is the\nmost economical.  I believe it is very dull, but I hope it will do\nGeorgina good.  I am afraid, however, that nothing will do her good until\nshe consents to take more care of herself; I am afraid she is very wild\nand wilful, and mamma tells me that all this month it has taken papa's\npositive orders to make her stop in-doors.  She is very cross (mamma\nwrites me) about coming abroad, and doesn't seem at all to mind the\nexpense that papa has been put to--talks very ill-naturedly about losing\nthe hunting, etc.  She expected to begin to hunt in December, and wants\nto know whether anybody keeps hounds at Hyeres.  Fancy a girl wanting to\nfollow the hounds when her lungs are so bad!  But I daresay that when she\ngets there she will he glad enough to keep quiet, as they say that the\nheat is intense.  It may cure Georgina, but I am sure it will make the\nrest of us very ill.\n\nMamma, however, is only going to bring Mary and Gus and Fred and Adelaide\nabroad with her; the others will remain at Kingscote until February\n(about the 3d), when they will go to Eastbourne for a month with Miss\nTurnover, the new governess, who has turned out such a very nice person.\nShe is going to take Miss Travers, who has been with us so long, but who\nis only qualified for the younger children, to Hyeres, and I believe some\nof the Kingscote servants.  She has perfect confidence in Miss T.; it is\nonly a pity she has such an odd name.  Mamma thought of asking her if she\nwould mind taking another when she came; but papa thought she might\nobject.  Lady Battledown makes all her governesses take the same name;\nshe gives 5 pounds more a year for the purpose.  I forget what it is she\ncalls them; I think it's Johnson (which to me always suggests a lady's\nmaid).  Governesses shouldn't have too pretty a name; they shouldn't have\na nicer name than the family.\n\nI suppose you heard from the Desmonds that I did not go back to England\nwith them.  When it began to be talked about that Georgina should be\ntaken abroad, mamma wrote to me that I had better stop in Paris for a\nmonth with Harold, so that she could pick me up on their way to Hyeres.\nIt saves the expense of my journey to Kingscote and back, and gives me\nthe opportunity to \"finish\" a little in French.\n\nYou know Harold came here six weeks ago, to get up his French for those\ndreadful examinations that he has to pass so soon.  He came to live with\nsome French people that take in young men (and others) for this purpose;\nit's a kind of coaching place, only kept by women.  Mamma had heard it\nwas very nice; so she wrote to me that I was to come and stop here with\nHarold.  The Desmonds brought me and made the arrangement, or the\nbargain, or whatever you call it.  Poor Harold was naturally not at all\npleased; but he has been very kind, and has treated me like an angel.  He\nis getting on beautifully with his French; for though I don't think the\nplace is so good as papa supposed, yet Harold is so immensely clever that\nhe can scarcely help learning.  I am afraid I learn much less, but,\nfortunately, I have not to pass an examination--except if mamma takes it\ninto her head to examine me.  But she will have so much to think of with\nGeorgina that I hope this won't occur to her.  If it does, I shall be, as\nHarold says, in a dreadful funk.\n\nThis is not such a nice place for a girl as for a young man, and the\nDesmonds thought it _exceedingly odd_ that mamma should wish me to come\nhere.  As Mrs. Desmond said, it is because she is so very unconventional.\nBut you know Paris is so very amusing, and if only Harold remains good-\nnatured about it, I shall be content to wait for the caravan (that's what\nhe calls mamma and the children).  The person who keeps the\nestablishment, or whatever they call it, is rather odd, and _exceedingly\nforeign_; but she is wonderfully civil, and is perpetually sending to my\ndoor to see if I want anything.  The servants are not at all like English\nservants, and come bursting in, the footman (they have only one) and the\nmaids alike, at all sorts of hours, in the _most sudden way_.  Then when\none rings, it is half an hour before they come.  All this is very\nuncomfortable, and I daresay it will be worse at Hyeres.  There, however,\nfortunately, we shall have our own people.\n\nThere are some very odd Americans here, who keep throwing Harold into\nfits of laughter.  One is a dreadful little man who is always sitting\nover the fire, and talking about the colour of the sky.  I don't believe\nhe ever saw the sky except through the window--pane.  The other day he\ntook hold of my frock (that green one you thought so nice at Homburg) and\ntold me that it reminded him of the texture of the Devonshire turf.  And\nthen he talked for half an hour about the Devonshire turf; which I\nthought such a very extraordinary subject.  Harold says he is mad.  It is\nvery strange to be living in this way with people one doesn't know.  I\nmean that one doesn't know as one knows them in England.\n\nThe other Americans (beside the madman) are two girls, about my own age,\none of whom is rather nice.  She has a mother; but the mother is always\nsitting in her bedroom, which seems so very odd.  I should like mamma to\nask them to Kingscote, but I am afraid mamma wouldn't like the mother,\nwho is rather vulgar.  The other girl is rather vulgar too, and is\ntravelling about quite alone.  I think she is a kind of schoolmistress;\nbut the other girl (I mean the nicer one, with the mother) tells me she\nis more respectable than she seems.  She has, however, the most\nextraordinary opinions--wishes to do away with the aristocracy, thinks it\nwrong that Arthur should have Kingscote when papa dies, etc.  I don't see\nwhat it signifies to her that poor Arthur should come into the property,\nwhich will be so delightful--except for papa dying.  But Harold says she\nis mad.  He chaffs her tremendously about her radicalism, and he is so\nimmensely clever that she can't answer him, though she is rather clever\ntoo.\n\nThere is also a Frenchman, a nephew, or cousin, or something, of the\nperson of the house, who is extremely nasty; and a German professor, or\ndoctor, who eats with his knife and is a great bore.  I am so very sorry\nabout giving up my visit.  I am afraid you will never ask me again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nFROM LEON VERDIER, IN PARIS, TO PROSPER GOBAIN, AT LILLE.\n\nSeptember 28th.\n\nMy Dear Prosper--It is a long time since I have given you of my news, and\nI don't know what puts it into my head to-night to recall myself to your\naffectionate memory.  I suppose it is that when we are happy the mind\nreverts instinctively to those with whom formerly we shared our\nexaltations and depressions, and _je t'eu ai trop dit, dans le bon temps,\nmon gros Prosper_, and you always listened to me too imperturbably, with\nyour pipe in your mouth, your waistcoat unbuttoned, for me not to feel\nthat I can count upon your sympathy to-day.  _Nous en sommes nous\nflanquees des confidences_--in those happy days when my first thought in\nseeing an adventure _poindre a l'horizon_ was of the pleasure I should\nhave in relating it to the great Prosper.  As I tell thee, I am happy;\ndecidedly, I am happy, and from this affirmation I fancy you can\nconstruct the rest.  Shall I help thee a little?  Take three adorable\ngirls . . . three, my good Prosper--the mystic number--neither more nor\nless.  Take them and place thy insatiable little Leon in the midst of\nthem!  Is the situation sufficiently indicated, and do you apprehend the\nmotives of my felicity?\n\nYou expected, perhaps, I was going to tell you that I had made my\nfortune, or that the Uncle Blondeau had at last decided to return into\nthe breast of nature, after having constituted me his universal legatee.\nBut I needn't remind you that women are always for something in the\nhappiness of him who writes to thee--for something in his happiness, and\nfor a good deal more in his misery.  But don't let me talk of misery now;\ntime enough when it comes; _ces demoiselles_ have gone to join the\nserried ranks of their amiable predecessors.  Excuse me--I comprehend\nyour impatience.  I will tell you of whom _ces demoiselles_ consist.\n\nYou have heard me speak of my _cousine_ de Maisonrouge, that grande\n_belle femme_, who, after having married, _en secondes_ noces--there had\nbeen, to tell the truth, some irregularity about her first union--a\nvenerable relic of the old noblesse of Poitou, was left, by the death of\nher husband, complicated by the indulgence of expensive tastes on an\nincome of 17,000 francs, on the pavement of Paris, with two little demons\nof daughters to bring up in the path of virtue.  She managed to bring\nthem up; my little cousins are rigidly virtuous.  If you ask me how she\nmanaged it, I can't tell you; it's no business of mine, and, _a fortiori_\nnone of yours.  She is now fifty years old (she confesses to\nthirty-seven), and her daughters, whom she has never been able to marry,\nare respectively twenty-seven and twenty-three (they confess to twenty\nand to seventeen).  Three years ago she had the thrice-blessed idea of\nopening a sort of _pension_ for the entertainment and instruction of the\nblundering barbarians who come to Paris in the hope of picking up a few\nstray particles of the language of Voltaire--or of Zola.  The idea _lui a\nporte bonheur_; the shop does a very good business.  Until within a few\nmonths ago it was carried on by my cousins alone; but lately the need of\na few extensions and embellishments has caused itself to be felt.  My\ncousin has undertaken them, regardless of expense; she has asked me to\ncome and stay with her--board and lodging gratis--and keep an eye on the\ngrammatical eccentricities of her _pensionnaires_.  I am the extension,\nmy good Prosper; I am the embellishment!  I live for nothing, and I\nstraighten up the accent of the prettiest English lips.  The English lips\nare not all pretty, heaven knows, but enough of them are so to make it a\ngaining bargain for me.\n\nJust now, as I told you, I am in daily conversation with three separate\npairs.  The owner of one of them has private lessons; she pays extra.  My\ncousin doesn't give me a sou of the money; but I make bold, nevertheless,\nto say that my trouble is remunerated.  But I am well, very well, with\nthe proprietors of the two other pairs.  One of them is a little\nAnglaise, of about twenty--a little _figure de keepsake_; the most\nadorable miss that you ever, or at least that I ever beheld.  She is\ndecorated all over with beads and bracelets and embroidered dandelions;\nbut her principal decoration consists of the softest little gray eyes in\nthe world, which rest upon you with a profundity of confidence--a\nconfidence that I really feel some compunction in betraying.  She has a\ntint as white as this sheet of paper, except just in the middle of each\ncheek, where it passes into the purest and most transparent, most liquid,\ncarmine.  Occasionally this rosy fluid overflows into the rest of her\nface--by which I mean that she blushes--as softly as the mark of your\nbreath on the window-pane.\n\nLike every Anglaise, she is rather pinched and prim in public; but it is\nvery easy to see that when no one is looking _elle ne demande qu'a se\nlaisser aller_!  Whenever she wants it I am always there, and I have\ngiven her to understand that she can count upon me.  I have reason to\nbelieve that she appreciates the assurance, though I am bound in honesty\nto confess that with her the situation is a little less advanced than\nwith the others.  _Que voulez-vous_?  The English are heavy, and the\nAnglaises move slowly, that's all.  The movement, however, is\nperceptible, and once this fact is established I can let the pottage\nsimmer.  I can give her time to arrive, for I am over-well occupied with\nher _concurrentes_.  _Celles-ci_ don't keep me waiting, _par exemple_!\n\nThese young ladies are Americans, and you know that it is the national\ncharacter to move fast.  \"All right--go ahead!\"  (I am learning a great\ndeal of English, or, rather, a great deal of American.)  They go ahead at\na rate that sometimes makes it difficult for me to keep up.  One of them\nis prettier than the other; but this hatter (the one that takes the\nprivate lessons) is really _une file prodigieuse_.  _Ah, par exemple,\nelle brule ses vais-seux cella-la_!  She threw herself into my arms the\nvery first day, and I almost owed her a grudge for having deprived me of\nthat pleasure of gradation, of carrying the defences, one by one, which\nis almost as great as that of entering the place.\n\nWould you believe that at the end of exactly twelve minutes she gave me a\nrendezvous?  It is true it was in the Galerie d'Apollon, at the Louvre;\nbut that was respectable for a beginning, and since then we have had them\nby the dozen; I have ceased to keep the account.  _Non, c'est une file\nqui me depasse_.\n\nThe little one (she has a mother somewhere, out of sight, shut up in a\ncloset or a trunk) is a good deal prettier, and, perhaps, on that account\n_elle y met plus de facons_.  She doesn't knock about Paris with me by\nthe hour; she contents herself with long interviews in the _petit salon_,\nwith the curtains half-drawn, beginning at about three o'clock, when\nevery one is _a la promenade_.  She is admirable, this little one; a\nlittle too thin, the bones rather accentuated, but the detail, on the\nwhole, most satisfactory.  And you can say anything to her.  She takes\nthe trouble to appear not to understand, but her conduct, half an hour\nafterwards, reassures you completely--oh, completely!\n\nHowever, it is the tall one, the one of the private lessons, that is the\nmost remarkable.  These private lessons, my good Prosper, are the most\nbrilliant invention of the age, and a real stroke of genius on the part\nof Miss Miranda!  They also take place in the _petit salon_, but with the\ndoors tightly closed, and with explicit directions to every one in the\nhouse that we are not to be disturbed.  And we are not, my good Prosper;\nwe are not!  Not a sound, not a shadow, interrupts our felicity.  My\n_cousine_ is really admirable; the shop deserves to succeed.  Miss\nMiranda is tall and rather flat; she is too pale; she hasn't the adorable\n_rougeurs_ of the little Anglaise.  But she has bright, keen, inquisitive\neyes, superb teeth, a nose modelled by a sculptor, and a way of holding\nup her head and looking every one in the face, which is the most finished\npiece of impertinence I ever beheld.  She is making the _tour du monde_\nentirely alone, without even a soubrette to carry the ensign, for the\npurpose of seeing for herself _a quoi s'en tenir sur les hommes et les\nchoses--on les hommes_ particularly.  _Dis donc_, Prosper, it must be a\n_drole de pays_ over there, where young persons animated by this ardent\ncuriosity are manufactured!  If we should turn the tables, some day, thou\nand I, and go over and see it for ourselves.  It is as well that we\nshould go and find them _chez elles_, as that they should come out here\nafter us.  _Dis donc, mon gras Prosper_ . . .\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nFROM DR. RUDOLF STAUB, IN PARIS, TO DR. JULIUS HIRSCH, AT GOTTINGEN.\n\nMy dear brother in Science--I resume my hasty notes, of which I sent you\nthe first instalment some weeks ago.  I mentioned then that I intended to\nleave my hotel, not finding it sufficiently local and national.  It was\nkept by a Pomeranian, and the waiters, without exception, were from the\nFatherland.  I fancied myself at Berlin, Unter den Linden, and I\nreflected that, having taken the serious step of visiting the\nhead-quarters of the Gallic genius, I should try and project myself; as\nmuch as possible, into the circumstances which are in part the\nconsequence and in part the cause of its irrepressible activity.  It\nseemed to me that there could be no well-grounded knowledge without this\npreliminary operation of placing myself in relations, as slightly as\npossible modified by elements proceeding from a different combination of\ncauses, with the spontaneous home-life of the country.\n\nI accordingly engaged a room in the house of a lady of pure French\nextraction and education, who supplements the shortcomings of an income\ninsufficient to the ever-growing demands of the Parisian system of sense-\ngratification, by providing food and lodging for a limited number of\ndistinguished strangers.  I should have preferred to have my room alone\nin the house, and to take my meals in a brewery, of very good appearance,\nwhich I speedily discovered in the same street; but this arrangement,\nthough very lucidly proposed by myself; was not acceptable to the\nmistress of the establishment (a woman with a mathematical head), and I\nhave consoled myself for the extra expense by fixing my thoughts upon the\nopportunity that conformity to the customs of the house gives me of\nstudying the table-manners of my companions, and of observing the French\nnature at a peculiarly physiological moment, the moment when the\nsatisfaction of the _taste_, which is the governing quality in its\ncomposition, produces a kind of exhalation, an intellectual\ntranspiration, which, though light and perhaps invisible to a superficial\nspectator, is nevertheless appreciable by a properly adjusted instrument.\n\nI have adjusted my instrument very satisfactorily (I mean the one I carry\nin my good square German head), and I am not afraid of losing a single\ndrop of this valuable fluid, as it condenses itself upon the plate of my\nobservation.  A prepared surface is what I need, and I have prepared my\nsurface.\n\nUnfortunately here, also, I find the individual native in the minority.\nThere are only four French persons in the house--the individuals\nconcerned in its management, three of whom are women, and one a man.  This\npreponderance of the feminine element is, however, in itself\ncharacteristic, as I need not remind you what an abnormally--developed\npart this sex has played in French history.  The remaining figure is\napparently that of a man, but I hesitate to classify him so\nsuperficially.  He appears to me less human than simian, and whenever I\nhear him talk I seem to myself to have paused in the street to listen to\nthe shrill clatter of a hand-organ, to which the gambols of a hairy\n_homunculus_ form an accompaniment.\n\nI mentioned to you before that my expectation of rough usage, in\nconsequence of my German nationality, had proved completely unfounded.  No\none seems to know or to care what my nationality is, and I am treated, on\nthe contrary, with the civility which is the portion of every traveller\nwho pays the bill without scanning the items too narrowly.  This, I\nconfess, has been something of a surprise to me, and I have not yet made\nup my mind as to the fundamental cause of the anomaly.  My determination\nto take up my abode in a French interior was largely dictated by the\nsupposition that I should be substantially disagreeable to its inmates.  I\nwished to observe the different forms taken by the irritation that I\nshould naturally produce; for it is under the influence of irritation\nthat the French character most completely expresses itself.  My presence,\nhowever, does not appear to operate as a stimulus, and in this respect I\nam materially disappointed.  They treat me as they treat every one else;\nwhereas, in order to be treated differently, I was resigned in advance to\nbe treated worse.  I have not, as I say, fully explained to myself this\nlogical contradiction; but this is the explanation to which I tend.  The\nFrench are so exclusively occupied with the idea of themselves, that in\nspite of the very definite image the German personality presented to them\nby the war of 1870, they have at present no distinct apprehension of its\nexistence.  They are not very sure that there are any Germans; they have\nalready forgotten the convincing proofs of the fact that were presented\nto them nine years ago.  A German was something disagreeable, which they\ndetermined to keep out of their conception of things.  I therefore think\nthat we are wrong to govern ourselves upon the hypothesis of the\n_revanche_; the French nature is too shallow for that large and powerful\nplant to bloom in it.\n\nThe English-speaking specimens, too, I have not been willing to neglect\nthe opportunity to examine; and among these I have paid special attention\nto the American varieties, of which I find here several singular\nexamples.  The two most remarkable are a young man who presents all the\ncharacteristics of a period of national decadence; reminding me strongly\nof some diminutive Hellenised Roman of the third century.  He is an\nillustration of the period of culture in which the faculty of\nappreciation has obtained such a preponderance over that of production\nthat the latter sinks into a kind of rank sterility, and the mental\ncondition becomes analogous to that of a malarious bog.  I learn from him\nthat there is an immense number of Americans exactly resembling him, and\nthat the city of Boston, indeed, is almost exclusively composed of them.\n(He communicated this fact very proudly, as if it were greatly to the\ncredit of his native country; little perceiving the truly sinister\nimpression it made upon me.)\n\nWhat strikes one in it is that it is a phenomenon to the best of my\nknowledge--and you know what my knowledge is--unprecedented and unique in\nthe history of mankind; the arrival of a nation at an ultimate stage of\nevolution without having passed through the mediate one; the passage of\nthe fruit, in other words, from crudity to rottenness, without the\ninterposition of a period of useful (and ornamental) ripeness.  With the\nAmericans, indeed, the crudity and the rottenness are identical and\nsimultaneous; it is impossible to say, as in the conversation of this\ndeplorable young man, which is one and which is the other; they are\ninextricably mingled.  I prefer the talk of the French _homunculus_; it\nis at least more amusing.\n\nIt is interesting in this manner to perceive, so largely developed, the\ngerms of extinction in the so-called powerful Anglo-Saxon family.  I find\nthem in almost as recognisable a form in a young woman from the State of\nMaine, in the province of New England, with whom I have had a good deal\nof conversation.  She differs somewhat from the young man I just\nmentioned, in that the faculty of production, of action, is, in her, less\ninanimate; she has more of the freshness and vigour that we suppose to\nbelong to a young civilisation.  But unfortunately she produces nothing\nbut evil, and her tastes and habits are similarly those of a Roman lady\nof the lower Empire.  She makes no secret of them, and has, in fact,\nelaborated a complete system of licentious behaviour.  As the\nopportunities she finds in her own country do not satisfy her, she has\ncome to Europe \"to try,\" as she says, \"for herself.\"  It is the doctrine\nof universal experience professed with a cynicism that is really most\nextraordinary, and which, presenting itself in a young woman of\nconsiderable education, appears to me to be the judgment of a society.\n\nAnother observation which pushes me to the same induction--that of the\npremature vitiation of the American population--is the attitude of the\nAmericans whom I have before me with regard to each other.  There is\nanother young lady here, who is less abnormally developed than the one I\nhave just described, but who yet bears the stamp of this peculiar\ncombination of incompleteness and effeteness.  These three persons look\nwith the greatest mistrust and aversion upon each other; and each has\nrepeatedly taken me apart and assured me, secretly, that he or she only\nis the real, the genuine, the typical American.  A type that has lost\nitself before it has been fixed--what can you look for from this?\n\nAdd to this that there are two young Englanders in the house, who hate\nall the Americans in a lump, making between them none of the distinctions\nand favourable comparisons which they insist upon, and you will, I think,\nhold me warranted in believing that, between precipitate decay and\ninternecine enmities, the English-speaking family is destined to consume\nitself; and that with its decline the prospect of general pervasiveness,\nto which I alluded above, will brighten for the deep-lunged children of\nthe Fatherland!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nMIRANDA HOPE TO HER MOTHER.\n\nOctober 22d\n\nDear Mother--I am off in a day or two to visit some new country; I\nhaven't yet decided which.  I have satisfied myself with regard to\nFrance, and obtained a good knowledge of the language.  I have enjoyed my\nvisit to Madame de Maisonrouge deeply, and feel as if I were leaving a\ncircle of real friends.  Everything has gone on beautifully up to the\nend, and every one has been as kind and attentive as if I were their own\nsister, especially Mr. Verdier, the French gentleman, from whom I have\ngained more than I ever expected (in six weeks), and with whom I have\npromised to correspond.  So you can imagine me dashing off the most\ncorrect French letters; and, if you don't believe it, I will keep the\nrough draft to show you when I go back.\n\nThe German gentleman is also more interesting, the more you know him; it\nseems sometimes as if I could fairly drink in his ideas.  I have found\nout why the young lady from New York doesn't like me!  It is because I\nsaid one day at dinner that I admired to go to the Louvre.  Well, when I\nfirst came, it seemed as if I _did_ admire everything!\n\nTell William Platt his letter has come.  I knew he would have to write,\nand I was bound I would make him!  I haven't decided what country I will\nvisit yet; it seems as if there were so many to choose from.  But I shall\ntake care to pick out a good one, and to meet plenty of fresh\nexperiences.\n\nDearest mother, my money holds out, and it _is_ most interesting!",
