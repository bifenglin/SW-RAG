The room is old fashioned,\n     furnished with well-worn  mahogany and leather, and lined with\n     tin boxes and   estate plans.  It has three doors.  Two of them\n     are close together in the centre of a wall.  One of these two\n     doors leads to the outer office, which is only divided from the\n     managing clerk's room by a   partition of wood and clear glass;\n     and when the door into this outer office is opened there can be\n     seen the wide outer door leading out on to the stone stairway of\n     the building.  The other of these two   centre doors leads to\n     the junior clerk's room.  The third door is that leading to the\n     partners' room.\n\n     The managing clerk, COKESON, is sitting at his table adding up\n     figures in a pass-book, and murmuring their numbers to himself.\n     He is a man of sixty, wearing spectacles; rather short, with a\n     bald head, and an honest, pugdog face.  He is dressed in a\n     well-worn black frock-coat and pepper-and-salt trousers.\n\nCOKESON.  And five's twelve, and three--fifteen, nineteen,\ntwenty-three, thirty-two, forty-one-and carry four. [He ticks the\npage, and goes on murmuring]  Five, seven, twelve, seventeen,\ntwenty-four and nine, thirty-three, thirteen and carry one.\n\n     He again makes a tick.  The outer office door is opened, and\n     SWEEDLE, the office-boy, appears, closing the door behind him.\n     He is a pale youth of sixteen, with spiky hair.\n\nCOKESON.  [With grumpy expectation]  And carry one.\n\nSWEEDLE.  There's a party wants to see Falder, Mr. Cokeson.\n\nCOKESON.  Five, nine, sixteen, twenty-one, twenty-nine--and carry\ntwo.  Send him to Morris's.  What name?\n\nSWEEDLE.  Honeywill.\n\nCOKESON.  What's his business?\n\nSWEEDLE.  It's a woman.\n\nCOKESON.  A lady?\n\nSWEEDLE.  No, a person.\n\nCOKESON.  Ask her in.  Take this pass-book to Mr. James.  [He closes\nthe pass-book.]\n\nSWEEDLE.  [Reopening the door]  Will you come in, please?\n\n     RUTH HONEYWILL comes in.  She is a tall woman, twenty-six years\n     old, unpretentiously dressed, with black hair and eyes, and an\n     ivory-white, clear-cut face.  She stands very still, having a\n     natural dignity of pose and gesture.\n\n     SWEEDLE goes out into the partners' room with the pass-book.\n\nCOKESON.  [Looking round at RUTH]  The young man's out.\n[Suspiciously]  State your business, please.\n\nRUTH.  [Who speaks in a matter-of-fact voice, and with a slight\nWest-Country accent]  It's a personal matter, sir.\n\nCOKESON.  We don't allow private callers here.  Will you leave a\nmessage?\n\nRUTH.  I'd rather see him, please.\n\n     She narrows her dark eyes and gives him a honeyed look.\n\nCOKESON.  [Expanding]  It's all against the rules.  Suppose I had my\nfriends here to see me!  It'd never do!\n\nRUTH.  No, sir.\n\nCOKESON.  [A little taken aback]  Exactly!  And here you are wanting\nto see a junior clerk!\n\nRUTH.  Yes, sir; I must see him.\n\nCOKESON.  [Turning full round to her with a sort of outraged\ninterest]  But this is a lawyer's office.  Go to his private address.\n\nRUTH.  He's not there.\n\nCOKESON.  [Uneasy]  Are you related to the party?\n\nRUTH.  No, sir.\n\nCOKESON.  [In real embarrassment]  I don't know what to say.  It's no\naffair of the office.\n\nRUTH.  But what am I to do?\n\nCOKESON.  Dear me!  I can't tell you that.\n\n     SWEEDLE comes back.  He crosses to the outer office and passes\n     through into it, with a quizzical look at Cokeson, carefully\n     leaving the door an inch or two open.\n\nCOKESON.  [Fortified by this look]  This won't do, you know, this\nwon't do at all.  Suppose one of the partners came in!\n\n     An incoherent knocking and chuckling is heard from the outer\n     door of the outer office.\n\nSWEEDLE.  [Putting his head in]  There's some children outside here.\n\nRUTH.  They're mine, please.\n\nSWEEDLE.  Shall I hold them in check?\n\nRUTH.  They're quite small, sir. [She takes a step towards COKESON]\n\nCOKESON.  You mustn't take up his time in office hours; we're a clerk\nshort as it is.\n\nRUTH.  It's a matter of life and death.\n\nCOKESON.  [Again outraged]  Life and death!\n\nSWEEDLE.  Here is Falder.\n\n     FALDER has entered through the outer office.  He is a pale,\n     good-looking young man, with quick, rather scared eyes.  He\n     moves towards the door of the clerks' office, and stands there\n     irresolute.\n\nCOKESON.  Well, I'll give you a minute.  It's not regular.\n\n     Taking up a bundle of papers, he goes out into the partners'\n     room.\n\nRUTH.  [In a low, hurried voice]  He's on the drink again, Will.  He\ntried to cut my throat last night.  I came out with the children\nbefore he was awake.  I went round to you.\n\nFALDER.  I've changed my digs.\n\nRUTH.  Is it all ready for to-night?\n\nFALDER.  I've got the tickets.  Meet me 11.45 at the booking office.\nFor God's sake don't forget we're man and wife!  [Looking at her with\ntragic intensity]  Ruth!\n\nRUTH.  You're not afraid of going, are you?\n\nFALDER.  Have you got your things, and the children's?\n\nRUTH.  Had to leave them, for fear of waking Honeywill, all but one\nbag.  I can't go near home again.\n\nFALDER.  [Wincing]  All that money gone for nothing.\nHow much must you have?\n\nRUTH.  Six pounds--I could do with that, I think.\n\nFALDER.  Don't give away where we're going.  [As if to himself]  When\nI get out there I mean to forget it all.\n\nRUTH.  If you're sorry, say so.  I'd sooner he killed me than take\nyou against your will.\n\nFALDER.  [With a queer smile]  We've got to go.  I don't care; I'll\nhave you.\n\nRUTH.  You've just to say; it's not too late.\n\nFALDER.  It is too late.  Here's seven pounds.  Booking office 11.45\nto-night.  If you weren't what you are to me, Ruth----!\n\nRUTH.  Kiss me!\n\n     They cling together passionately, there fly apart just as\n     COKESON re-enters the room.  RUTH turns and goes out through the\n     outer office.  COKESON advances deliberately to his chair and\n     seats himself.\n\nCOKESON.  This isn't right, Falder.\n\nFALDER.  It shan't occur again, sir.\n\nCOKESON.  It's an improper use of these premises.\n\nFALDER.  Yes, sir.\n\nCOKESON.  You quite understand-the party was in some distress; and,\nhaving children with her, I allowed my feelings----[He opens a\ndrawer and produces from it a tract]  Just take this!  \"Purity in the\nHome.\"  It's a well-written thing.\n\nFALDER.  [Taking it, with a peculiar expression]  Thank you, sir.\n\nCOKESON.  And look here, Falder, before Mr. Walter comes, have you\nfinished up that cataloguing Davis had in hand before he left?\n\nFALDER.  I shall have done with it to-morrow, sir--for good.\n\nCOKESON.  It's over a week since Davis went.  Now it won't do,\nFalder.  You're neglecting your work for private life.  I shan't\nmention about the party having called, but----\n\nFALDER.  [Passing into his room] Thank you, sir.\n\n     COKESON stares at the door through which FALDER has gone out;\n     then shakes his head, and is just settling down to write, when\n     WALTER How comes in through the outer Office.  He is a rather\n     refined-looking man of thirty-five, with a pleasant, almost\n     apologetic voice.\n\nWALTER.  Good-morning, Cokeson.\n\nCOKESON.  Morning, Mr. Walter.\n\nWALTER.  My father here?\n\nCOKESON.  [Always with a certain patronage as to a young man who\nmight be doing better]  Mr. James has been here since eleven o'clock.\n\nWALTER.  I've been in to see the pictures, at the Guildhall.\n\nCOKESON.  [Looking at him as though this were exactly what was to be\nexpected]  Have you now--ye--es.  This lease of Boulter's--am I to\nsend it to counsel?\n\nWALTER.  What does my father say?\n\nCOKESON.  'Aven't bothered him.\n\nWALTER.  Well, we can't be too careful.\n\nCOKESON.  It's such a little thing--hardly worth the fees.  I thought\nyou'd do it yourself.\n\nWALTER.  Send it, please.  I don't want the responsibility.\n\nCOKESON.  [With an indescribable air of compassion]  Just as you\nlike.  This \"right-of-way\" case--we've got 'em on the deeds.\n\nWALTER.  I know; but the intention was obviously to exclude that bit\nof common ground.\n\nCOKESON.  We needn't worry about that.  We're the right side of the\nlaw.\n\nWALTER.  I don't like it,\n\nCOKESON.  [With an indulgent smile]  We shan't want to set ourselves\nup against the law.  Your father wouldn't waste his time doing that.\n\n     As he speaks JAMES How comes in from the partners' room.  He is\n     a shortish man, with white side-whiskers, plentiful grey hair,\n     shrewd eyes, and gold pince-nez.\n\nJAMES.  Morning, Walter.\n\nWALTER.  How are you, father?\n\nCOKESON.  [Looking down his nose at the papers in his hand as though\ndeprecating their size] I'll just take Boulter's lease in to young\nFalder to draft the instructions. [He goes out into FALDER'S room.]\n\nWALTER.  About that right-of-way case?\n\nJAMES.  Oh, well, we must go forward there.  I thought you told me\nyesterday the firm's balance was over four hundred.\n\nWALTER.  So it is.\n\nJAMES.  [Holding out the pass-book to his son] Three--five--one, no\nrecent cheques.  Just get me out the cheque-book.\n\n     WALTER goes to a cupboard, unlocks a drawer and produces a\n     cheque-book.\n\nJAMES.  Tick the pounds in the counterfoils.  Five, fifty-four,\nseven, five, twenty-eight, twenty, ninety, eleven, fifty-two,\nseventy-one.  Tally?\n\nWALTER.  [Nodding]  Can't understand.  Made sure it was over four\nhundred.\n\nJAMES.  Give me the cheque-book.  [He takes the check-book and cons\nthe counterfoils] What's this ninety?\n\nWALTER.  Who drew it?\n\nJAMES.  You.\n\nWALTER.  [Taking the cheque-book]  July 7th?  That's the day I went\ndown to look over the Trenton Estate--last Friday week; I came back\non the Tuesday, you remember.  But look here, father, it was nine I\ndrew a cheque for.  Five guineas to Smithers and my expenses.  It\njust covered all but half a crown.\n\nJAMES.  [Gravely]  Let's look at that ninety cheque.  [He sorts the\ncheque out from the bundle in the pocket of the pass-book] Seems all\nright.  There's no nine here.  This is bad.  Who cashed that\nnine-pound cheque?\n\nWALTER.  [Puzzled and pained]  Let's see!  I was finishing Mrs.\nReddy's will--only just had time; yes--I gave it to Cokeson.\n\nJAMES.  Look at that 't' 'y': that yours?\n\nWALTER.  [After consideration]  My y's curl back a little; this\ndoesn't.\n\nJAMES.  [As COKESON re-enters from FALDER'S room]  We must ask him.\nJust come here and carry your mind back a bit, Cokeson.  D'you\nremember cashing a cheque for Mr. Walter last Friday week--the day\nhe went to Trenton?\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es.  Nine pounds.\n\nJAMES.  Look at this.  [Handing him the cheque.]\n\nCOKESON.  No!  Nine pounds.  My lunch was just coming in; and of\ncourse I like it hot; I gave the cheque to Davis to run round to the\nbank.  He brought it back, all gold--you remember, Mr. Walter, you\nwanted some silver to pay your cab.  [With a certain contemptuous\ncompassion]  Here, let me see.  You've got the wrong cheque.\n\n     He takes cheque-book and pass-book from WALTER.\n\nWALTER.  Afraid not.\n\nCOKESON.  [Having seen for himself]  It's funny.\n\nJAMES.  You gave it to Davis, and Davis sailed for Australia on\nMonday.  Looks black, Cokeson.\n\nCOKESON.  [Puzzled and upset]  why this'd be a felony!  No, no!\nthere's some mistake.\n\nJAMES.  I hope so.\n\nCOKESON.  There's never been anything of that sort in the office the\ntwenty-nine years I've been here.\n\nJAMES.  [Looking at cheque and counterfoil]  This is a very clever\nbit of work; a warning to you not to leave space after your figures,\nWalter.\n\nWALTER.  [Vexed]  Yes, I know--I was in such a tearing hurry that\nafternoon.\n\nCOKESON.  [Suddenly]  This has upset me.\n\nJAMES.  The counterfoil altered too--very deliberate piece of\nswindling.  What was Davis's ship?\n\nWALTER.  'City of Rangoon'.\n\nJAMES.  We ought to wire and have him arrested at Naples; he can't be\nthere yet.\n\nCOKESON.  His poor young wife.  I liked the young man.  Dear, oh\ndear!  In this office!\n\nWALTER.  Shall I go to the bank and ask the cashier?\n\nJAMES.  [Grimly]  Bring him round here.  And ring up Scotland Yard.\n\nWALTER.  Really?\n\n     He goes out through the outer office.  JAMES paces the room.  He\n     stops and looks at COKESON, who is disconsolately rubbing the\n     knees of his trousers.\n\nJAMES.  Well, Cokeson!  There's something in character, isn't there?\n\nCOKESON.  [Looking at him over his spectacles]  I don't quite take\nyou, sir.\n\nJAMES.  Your story, would sound d----d thin to any one who didn't\nknow you.\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es!  [He laughs.  Then with a sudden gravity]  I'm sorry\nfor that young man.  I feel it as if it was my own son, Mr. James.\n\nJAMES.  A nasty business!\n\nCOKESON.  It unsettles you.  All goes on regular, and then a thing\nlike this happens.  Shan't relish my lunch to-day.\n\nJAMES.  As bad as that, Cokeson?\n\nCOKESON.  It makes you think.  [Confidentially]  He must have had\ntemptation.\n\nJAMES.  Not so fast.  We haven't convicted him yet.\n\nCOKESON.  I'd sooner have lost a month's salary than had this happen.\n    [He broods.]\n\nJAMES.  I hope that fellow will hurry up.\n\nCOKESON.  [Keeping things pleasant for the cashier]  It isn't fifty\nyards, Mr. James.  He won't be a minute.\n\nJAMES.  The idea of dishonesty about this office it hits me hard,\nCokeson.\n\n     He goes towards the door of the partners' room.\n\nSWEEDLE.  [Entering quietly, to COKESON in a low voice]  She's popped\nup again, sir-something she forgot to say to Falder.\n\nCOKESON.  [Roused from his abstraction]  Eh?  Impossible.  Send her\naway!\n\nJAMES.  What's that?\n\nCOKESON.  Nothing, Mr. James.  A private matter.  Here, I'll come\nmyself.  [He goes into the outer office as JAMES passes into the\npartners' room]  Now, you really mustn't--we can't have anybody just\nnow.\n\nRUTH.  Not for a minute, sir?\n\nCOKESON.  Reely!  Reely!  I can't have it.  If you want him, wait\nabout; he'll be going out for his lunch directly.\n\nRUTH.  Yes, sir.\n\n     WALTER, entering with the cashier, passes RUTH as she leaves the\n     outer office.\n\nCOKESON.  [To the cashier, who resembles a sedentary dragoon]\nGood-morning.  [To WALTER]  Your father's in there.\n\n     WALTER crosses and goes into the partners' room.\n\nCOKESON.  It's a nahsty, unpleasant little matter, Mr. Cowley.  I'm\nquite ashamed to have to trouble you.\n\nCOWLEY.  I remember the cheque quite well.  [As if it were a liver]\nSeemed in perfect order.\n\nCOKESON.  Sit down, won't you?  I'm not a sensitive man, but a thing\nlike this about the place--it's not nice.  I like people to be open\nand jolly together.\n\nCOWLEY.  Quite so.\n\nCOKESON.  [Buttonholing him, and glancing toward the partners' room]\nOf course he's a young man.  I've told him about it before now--\nleaving space after his figures, but he will do it.\n\nCOWLEY.  I should remember the person's face--quite a youth.\n\nCOKESON.  I don't think we shall be able to show him to you, as a\nmatter of fact.\n\n     JAMES and WALTER have come back from the partners' room.\n\nJAMES.  Good-morning, Mr. Cowley.  You've seen my son and myself,\nyou've seen Mr. Cokeson, and you've seen Sweedle, my office-boy.  It\nwas none of us, I take it.\n\n     The cashier shakes his head with a smile.\n\nJAMES.  Be so good as to sit there.  Cokeson, engage Mr. Cowley in\nconversation, will you?\n\n     He goes toward FALDER'S room.\n\nCOKESON.  Just a word, Mr. James.\n\nJAMES.  Well?\n\nCOKESON.  You don't want to upset the young man in there, do you?\nHe's a nervous young feller.\n\nJAMES.  This must be thoroughly cleared up, Cokeson, for the sake of\nFalder's name, to say nothing of yours.\n\nCOKESON.  [With Some dignity] That'll look after itself, sir.  He's\nbeen upset once this morning; I don't want him startled again.\n\nJAMES.  It's a matter of form; but I can't stand upon niceness over a\nthing like this--too serious.  Just talk to Mr. Cowley.\n\n     He opens the door of FALDER'S room.\n\nJAMES.  Bring in the papers in Boulter's lease, will you, Falder?\n\nCOKESON.  [Bursting into voice]  Do you keep dogs?\n\n     The cashier, with his eyes fixed on the door, does not answer.\n\nCOKESON.  You haven't such a thing as a bulldog pup you could spare\nme, I suppose?\n\n     At the look on the cashier's face his jaw drops, and he turns to\n     see FALDER standing in the doorway, with his eyes fixed on\n     COWLEY, like the eyes of a rabbit fastened on a snake.\n\nFALDER.  [Advancing with the papers] Here they are, sir!\n\nJAMES.  [Taking them] Thank you.\n\nFALDER.  Do you want me, sir?\n\nJAMES.  No, thanks!\n\n     FALDER turns and goes back into his own room.  As he shuts the\n     door JAMES gives the cashier an interrogative look, and the\n     cashier nods.\n\nJAMES.  Sure?  This isn't as we suspected.\n\nCOWLEY.  Quite.  He knew me.  I suppose he can't slip out of that\nroom?\n\nCOKESON.  [Gloomily]  There's only the window--a whole floor and a\nbasement.\n\n     The door of FALDER'S room is quietly opened, and FALDER, with\n     his hat in his hand, moves towards the door of the outer office.\n\nJAMES.  [Quietly]  Where are you going, Falder?\n\nFALDER.  To have my lunch, sir.\n\nJAMES.  Wait a few minutes, would you?  I want to speak to you about\nthis lease.\n\nFALDER.  Yes, sir.  [He goes back into his room.]\n\nCOWLEY.  If I'm wanted, I can swear that's the young man who cashed\nthe cheque.  It was the last cheque I handled that morning before my\nlunch.  These are the numbers of the notes he had.  [He puts a slip\nof paper on the table; then, brushing his hat round]  Good-morning!\n\nJAMES.  Good-morning, Mr. Cowley!\n\nCOWLEY.  [To COKESON]  Good-morning.\n\nCOKESON.  [With Stupefaction]  Good-morning.\n\n     The cashier goes out through the outer office. COKESON sits down\n     in his chair, as though it were the only place left in the\n     morass of his feelings.\n\nWALTER.  What are you going to do?\n\nJAMES.  Have him in.  Give me the cheque and the counterfoil.\n\nCOKESON.  I don't understand.  I thought young Davis----\n\nJAMES.  We shall see.\n\nWALTER.  One moment, father: have you thought it out?\n\nJAMES.  Call him in!\n\nCOKESON.  [Rising with difficulty and opening FALDER'S door;\nhoarsely]  Step in here a minute.\n\nFALDER.  [Impassively]  Yes, sir?\n\nJAMES.  [Turning to him suddenly with the cheque held out]  You know\nthis cheque, Falder?\n\nFALDER.  No, sir.\n\nJADES.  Look at it.  You cashed it last Friday week.\n\nFALDER.  Oh! yes, sir; that one--Davis gave it me.\n\nJAMES.  I know. And you gave Davis the cash?\n\nFALDER.  Yes, sir.\n\nJAMES.  When Davis gave you the cheque was it exactly like this?\n\nFALDER.  Yes, I think so, sir.\n\nJAMES.  You know that Mr. Walter drew that cheque for nine pounds?\n\nFALDER.  No, sir--ninety.\n\nJAMES.  Nine, Falder.\n\nFALDER.  [Faintly]  I don't understand, sir.\n\nJAMES.  The suggestion, of course, is that the cheque was altered;\nwhether by you or Davis is the question.\n\nFALDER.  I--I\n\nCOKESON.  Take your time, take your time.\n\nFALDER.  [Regaining his impassivity]  Not by me, sir.\n\nJAMES.  The cheque was handed to--Cokeson by Mr. Walter at one\no'clock; we know that because Mr. Cokeson's lunch had just arrived.\n\nCOKESON.  I couldn't leave it.\n\nJAMES.  Exactly; he therefore gave the cheque to Davis.  It was\ncashed by you at 1.15.  We know that because the cashier recollects\nit for the last cheque he handled before his lunch.\n\nFALDER.  Yes, sir, Davis gave it to me because some friends were\ngiving him a farewell luncheon.\n\nJAMES.  [Puzzled] You accuse Davis, then?\n\nFALDER.  I don't know, sir--it's very funny.\n\n     WALTER, who has come close to his father, says something to him\n     in a low voice.\n\nJAMES.  Davis was not here again after that Saturday, was he?\n\nCOKESON.  [Anxious to be of assistance to the young man, and seeing\nfaint signs of their all being jolly once more] No, he sailed on the\nMonday.\n\nJAMES.  Was he, Falder?\n\nFALDER.  [Very faintly]  No, sir.\n\nJAMES.  Very well, then, how do you account for the fact that this\nnought was added to the nine in the counterfoil on or after Tuesday?\n\nCOKESON.  [Surprised]  How's that?\n\n     FALDER gives a sort of lurch; he tries to pull himself together,\n     but he has gone all to pieces.\n\nJAMES.  [Very grimly]  Out, I'm afraid, Cokeson.  The cheque-book\nremained in Mr. Walter's pocket till he came back from Trenton on\nTuesday morning.  In the face of this, Falder, do you still deny that\nyou altered both cheque and counterfoil?\n\nFALDER.  No, sir--no, Mr. How.  I did it, sir; I did it.\n\nCOKESON.  [Succumbing to his feelings]  Dear, dear! what a thing to\ndo!\n\nFALDER.  I wanted the money so badly, sir.  I didn't know what I was\ndoing.\n\nCOKESON.  However such a thing could have come into your head!\n\nFALDER.  [Grasping at the words]  I can't think, sir, really!  It was\njust a minute of madness.\n\nJAMES.  A long minute, Falder.  [Tapping the counterfoil] Four days\nat least.\n\nFALDER.  Sir, I swear I didn't know what I'd done till afterwards,\nand then I hadn't the pluck.  Oh!  Sir, look over it!  I'll pay the\nmoney back--I will, I promise.\n\nJAMES.  Go into your room.\n\n     FALDER, with a swift imploring look, goes back into his room.\n     There is silence.\n\nJAMES.  About as bad a case as there could be.\n\nCOKESON.  To break the law like that-in here!\n\nWALTER.  What's to be done?\n\nJAMES.  Nothing for it.  Prosecute.\n\nWALTER.  It's his first offence.\n\nJAMES.  [Shaking his head]  I've grave doubts of that.  Too neat a\npiece of swindling altogether.\n\nCOKESON.  I shouldn't be surprised if he was tempted.\n\nJAMES.  Life's one long temptation, Cokeson.\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es, but I'm speaking of the flesh and the devil, Mr.\nJames.  There was a woman come to see him this morning.\n\nWALTER.  The woman we passed as we came in just now.  Is it his wife?\n\nCOKESON.  No, no relation.  [Restraining what in jollier\ncircumstances would have been a wink]  A married person, though.\n\nWALTER.  How do you know?\n\nCOKESON.  Brought her children.  [Scandalised]  There they were\noutside the office.\n\nJAMES.  A real bad egg.\n\nWALTER.  I should like to give him a chance.\n\nJAMES.  I can't forgive him for the sneaky way he went to work--\ncounting on our suspecting young Davis if the matter came to light.\nIt was the merest accident the cheque-book stayed in your pocket.\n\nWALTER.  It must have been the temptation of a moment.  He hadn't\ntime.\n\nJAMES.  A man doesn't succumb like that in a moment, if he's a clean\nmind and habits.  He's rotten; got the eyes of a man who can't keep\nhis hands off when there's money about.\n\nWALTER.  [Dryly] We hadn't noticed that before.\n\nJAMES.  [Brushing the remark aside] I've seen lots of those fellows\nin my time.  No doing anything with them except to keep 'em out of\nharm's way.  They've got a blind spat.\n\nWALTER.  It's penal servitude.\n\nCOKESON.  They're nahsty places-prisons.\n\nJAMES.  [Hesitating] I don't see how it's possible to spare him.  Out\nof the question to keep him in this office--honesty's the 'sine qua\nnon'.\n\nCOKESON.  [Hypnotised] Of course it is.\n\nJAMES.  Equally out of the question to send him out amongst people\nwho've no knowledge of his character.  One must think of society.\n\nWALTER.  But to brand him like this?\n\nJAMES.  If it had been a straightforward case I'd give him another\nchance.  It's far from that.  He has dissolute habits.\n\nCOKESON.  I didn't say that--extenuating circumstances.\n\nJAMES.  Same thing.  He's gone to work in the most cold-blooded way\nto defraud his employers, and cast the blame on an innocent man.  If\nthat's not a case for the law to take its course, I don't know what\nis.\n\nWALTER.  For the sake of his future, though.\n\nJAMES.  [Sarcastically]  According to you, no one would ever\nprosecute.\n\nWALTER.  [Nettled]  I hate the idea of it.\n\nCOKESON.  That's rather 'ex parte', Mr. Walter!  We must have\nprotection.\n\nJAMES.  This is degenerating into talk.\n\n     He moves towards the partners' room.\n\nWALTER.  Put yourself in his place, father.\n\nJAMES.  You ask too much of me.\n\nWALTER.  We can't possibly tell the pressure there was on him.\n\nJAMES.  You may depend on it, my boy, if a man is going to do this\nsort of thing he'll do it, pressure or no pressure; if he isn't\nnothing'll make him.\n\nWALTER.  He'll never do it again.\n\nCOKESON.  [Fatuously] S'pose I were to have a talk with him.  We\ndon't want to be hard on the young man.\n\nJAMES.  That'll do, Cokeson.  I've made up my mind.  [He passes into\nthe partners' room.]\n\nCOKESON.  [After a doubtful moment]  We must excuse your father.  I\ndon't want to go against your father; if he thinks it right.\n\nWALTER.  Confound it, Cokeson! why don't you back me up?  You know\nyou feel----\n\nCOKESON.  [On his dignity]  I really can't say what I feel.\n\nWALTER.  We shall regret it.\n\nCOKESON.  He must have known what he was doing.\n\nWALTER.  [Bitterly]  \"The quality of mercy is not strained.\"\n\nCOKESON.  [Looking at him askance]  Come, come, Mr. Walter.  We must\ntry and see it sensible.\n\nSWEEDLE.  [Entering with a tray] Your lunch, sir.\n\nCOKESON.  Put it down!\n\n     While SWEEDLE is putting it down on COKESON's table, the\n     detective, WISTER, enters the outer office, and, finding no one\n     there, comes to the inner doorway.  He is a square, medium-sized\n     man, clean-shaved, in a serviceable blue serge suit and strong\n     boots.\n\nCOKESON.  [Hoarsely]  Here!  Here!  What are we doing?\n\nWISTER.  [To WALTER]  From Scotland Yard, sir.  Detective-Sergeant\nBlister.\n\nWALTER.  [Askance] Very well!  I'll speak to my father.\n\n     He goes into the partners' room.  JAMES enters.\n\nJAMES.  Morning!  [In answer to an appealing gesture from COKESON]\nI'm sorry; I'd stop short of this if I felt I could.  Open that door.\n[SWEEDLE, wondering and scared, opens it] Come here, Mr. Falder.\n\n     As FALDER comes shrinkingly out, the detective in obedience to a\n     sign from JAMES, slips his hand out and grasps his arm.\n\nFALDER.  [Recoiling] Oh! no,--oh! no!\n\nWALTER.  Come, come, there's a good lad.\n\nJAMES.  I charge him with felony.\n\nFALTER.  Oh, sir!  There's some one--I did it for her.  Let me be\ntill to-morrow.\n\n     JAMES motions with his hand.  At that sign of hardness, FALDER\n     becomes rigid.  Then, turning, he goes out quietly in the\n     detective's grip.  JAMES follows, stiff and erect.  SWEEDLE,\n     rushing to the door with open mouth, pursues them through the\n     outer office into the corridor.  When they have all disappeared\n     COKESON spins completely round and makes a rush for the outer\n     office.\n\nCOKESON: [Hoarsely] Here!  What are we doing?\n\n     There is silence.  He takes out his handkerchief and mops the\n     sweat from his face.  Going back blindly to his table, sits\n     down, and stares blankly at his lunch.\n\n\n                         The curtain falls.\n\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\nA Court of Justice, on a foggy October afternoon crowded with\nbarristers, solicitors, reporters, ushers, and jurymen.  Sitting in\nthe large, solid dock is FALDER, with a warder on either side of him,\nplaced there for his safe custody, but seemingly indifferent to and\nunconscious of his presence.  FALDER is sitting exactly opposite to\nthe JUDGE, who, raised above the clamour of the court, also seems\nunconscious of and indifferent to everything.  HAROLD CLEAVER, the\ncounsel for the Crown, is a dried, yellowish man, of more than middle\nage, in a wig worn almost to the colour of his face.  HECTOR FROME,\nthe counsel for the defence, is a young, tall man, clean shaved, in a\nvery white wig.  Among the spectators,  having already given their\nevidence, are JAMES and WALTER HOW, and COWLEY, the cashier.  WISTER,\nthe detective, is just leaving the witness-box.\n\nCLEAVER.  That is the case for the Crown, me lud!\n\n     Gathering his robes together, he sits down.\n\nFROME.  [Rising and bowing to the JUDGE] If it please your lordship\nand gentlemen of the jury.  I am not going to dispute the fact that\nthe prisoner altered this cheque, but I am going to put before you\nevidence as to the condition of his mind, and to submit that you\nwould not be justified in finding that he was responsible for his\nactions at the time.  I am going to show you, in fact, that he did\nthis in a moment of aberration, amounting to temporary insanity,\ncaused by the violent distress under which he was labouring.\nGentlemen, the prisoner is only twenty-three years old.  I shall call\nbefore you a woman from whom you will learn the events that led up to\nthis act.  You will hear from her own lips the tragic circumstances\nof her life, the still more tragic infatuation with which she has\ninspired the prisoner.  This woman, gentlemen, has been leading a\nmiserable existence with a husband who habitually ill-uses her, from\nwhom she actually goes in terror of her life.  I am not, of course,\nsaying that it's either right or desirable for a young man to fall in\nlove with a married woman, or that it's his business to rescue her\nfrom an ogre-like husband.  I'm not saying anything of the sort.  But\nwe all know the power of the passion of love; and I would ask you to\nremember, gentlemen, in listening to her evidence, that, married to a\ndrunken and violent husband, she has no power to get rid of him; for,\nas you know, another offence besides violence is necessary to enable\na woman to obtain a divorce; and of this offence it does not appear\nthat her husband is guilty.\n\nJUDGE.  Is this relevant, Mr. Frome?\n\nFROME.  My lord, I submit, extremely--I shall be able to show your\nlordship that directly.\n\nJUDGE.  Very well.\n\nFROME.  In these circumstances, what alternatives were left to her?\nShe could either go on living with this drunkard, in terror of her\nlife; or she could apply to the Court for a separation order.  Well,\ngentlemen, my experience of such cases assures me that this would\nhave given her very insufficient protection from the violence of such\na man; and even if effectual would very likely have reduced her\neither to the workhouse or the streets--for it's not easy, as she is\nnow finding, for an unskilled woman without means of livelihood to\nsupport herself and her children without resorting either to the Poor\nLaw or--to speak quite plainly--to the sale of her body.\n\nJUDGE.  You are ranging rather far, Mr. Frome.\n\nFROME.  I shall fire point-blank in a minute, my lord.\n\nJUDGE.  Let us hope so.\n\nFROME.  Now, gentlemen, mark--and this is what I have been leading up\nto--this woman will tell you, and the prisoner will confirm her,\nthat, confronted with such alternatives, she set her whole hopes on\nhimself, knowing the feeling with which she had inspired him.  She\nsaw a way out of her misery by going with him to a new country, where\nthey would both be unknown, and might pass as husband and wife.  This\nwas a desperate and, as my friend Mr. Cleaver will no doubt call it,\nan immoral resolution; but, as a fact, the minds of both of them were\nconstantly turned towards it.  One wrong is no excuse for another,\nand those who are never likely to be faced by such a situation\npossibly have the right to hold up their hands--as to that I prefer\nto say nothing.  But whatever view you take, gentlemen, of this part\nof the prisoner's story--whatever opinion you form of the right of\nthese two young people under such circumstances to take the law into\ntheir own hands--the fact remains that this young woman in her\ndistress, and this young man, little more than a boy, who was so\ndevotedly attached to her, did conceive this--if you like--\nreprehensible design of going away together.  Now, for that, of\ncourse, they required money, and--they had none.  As to the actual\nevents of the morning of July 7th, on which this cheque was altered,\nthe events on which I rely to prove the defendant's irresponsibility\n--I shall allow those events to speak for themselves, through the\nlips of my witness.  Robert Cokeson.  [He turns, looks round, takes\nup a sheet of paper, and waits.]\n\n     COKESON is summoned into court, and goes into the witness-box,\n     holding his hat before him.  The oath is administered to him.\n\nFROME.  What is your name?\n\nCOKESON.  Robert Cokeson.\n\nFROME.  Are you managing clerk to the firm of solicitors who employ\nthe prisoner?\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es.\n\nFROME.  How long had the prisoner been in their employ?\n\nCOKESON.  Two years.  No, I'm wrong there--all but seventeen days.\n\nFROME.  Had you him under your eye all that time?\n\nCOKESON.  Except Sundays and holidays.\n\nFROME.  Quite so.  Let us hear, please, what you have to say about\nhis general character during those two years.\n\nCOKESON.  [Confidentially to the jury, and as if a little surprised\nat being asked]  He was a nice, pleasant-spoken young man.  I'd no\nfault to find with him--quite the contrary.  It was a great surprise\nto me when he did a thing like that.\n\nFROME.  Did he ever give you reason to suspect his honesty?\n\nCOKESON.  No!  To have dishonesty in our office, that'd never do.\n\nFROME.  I'm sure the jury fully appreciate that, Mr. Cokeson.\n\nCOKESON.  Every man of business knows that honesty's 'the sign qua\nnon'.\n\nFROME.  Do you give him a good character all round, or do you not?\n\nCOKESON.  [Turning to the JUDGE]  Certainly.  We were all very jolly\nand pleasant together, until this happened.  Quite upset me.\n\nFROME.  Now, coming to the morning of the 7th of July, the morning on\nwhich the cheque was altered.  What have you to say about his\ndemeanour that morning?\n\nCOKESON.  [To the jury]  If you ask me, I don't think he was quite\ncompos when he did it.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  [Sharply]  Are you suggesting that he was insane?\n\nCOKESON.  Not compos.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  A little more precision, please.\n\nFROME.  [Smoothly]  Just tell us, Mr. Cokeson.\n\nCOKESON.  [Somewhat outraged]  Well, in my opinion--[looking at the\nJUDGE]--such as it is--he was jumpy at the time.  The jury will\nunderstand my meaning.\n\nFROME.  Will you tell us how you came to that conclusion?\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es, I will.  I have my lunch in from the restaurant, a\nchop and a potato--saves time.  That day it happened to come just as\nMr. Walter How handed me the cheque.  Well, I like it hot; so I went\ninto the clerks' office and I handed the cheque to Davis, the other\nclerk, and told him to get change.  I noticed young Falder walking up\nand down.  I said to him: \"This is not the Zoological Gardens,\nFalder.\"\n\nFROME.  Do you remember what he answered?\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es: \"I wish to God it were!\"  Struck me as funny.\n\nFROME.  Did you notice anything else peculiar?\n\nCOKESON.  I did.\n\nFROME.  What was that?\n\nCOKESON.  His collar was unbuttoned.  Now, I like a young man to be\nneat.  I said to him: \"Your collar's unbuttoned.\"\n\nFROME.  And what did he answer?\n\nCOKESON.  Stared at me.  It wasn't nice.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Stared at you?  Isn't that a very common practice?\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es, but it was the look in his eyes.  I can't explain my\nmeaning--it was funny.\n\nFROME.  Had you ever seen such a look in his eyes before?\n\nCOKESON.  No.  If I had I should have spoken to the partners.  We\ncan't have anything eccentric in our profession.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Did you speak to them on that occasion?\n\nCOKESON.  [Confidentially]  Well, I didn't like to trouble them about\nprime facey evidence.\n\nFROME.  But it made a very distinct impression on your mind?\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es.  The clerk Davis could have told you the same.\n\nFROME.  Quite so.  It's very unfortunate that we've not got him here.\nNow can you tell me of the morning on which the discovery of the\nforgery was made?  That would be the 18th.  Did anything happen that\nmorning?\n\nCOKESON.  [With his hand to his ear]  I'm a little deaf.\n\nFROME.  Was there anything in the course of that morning--I mean\nbefore the discovery--that caught your attention?\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es--a woman.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  How is this relevant, Mr. Frome?\n\nFROME.  I am trying to establish the state of mind in which the\nprisoner committed this act, my lord.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  I quite appreciate that.  But this was long after the\nact.\n\nFROME.  Yes, my lord, but it contributes to my contention.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Well!\n\nFROME.  You say a woman.  Do you mean that she came to the office?\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es.\n\nFROME.  What for?\n\nCOKESON.  Asked to see young Falder; he was out at the moment.\n\nFROME.  Did you see her?\n\nCOKESON.  I did.\n\nFROME.  Did she come alone?\n\nCOKESON.  [Confidentially]  Well, there you put me in a difficulty.\nI mustn't tell you what the office-boy told me.\n\nFROME.  Quite so, Mr. Cokeson, quite so----\n\nCOKESON.  [Breaking in with an air of \"You are young--leave it to\nme\"]  But I think we can get round it.  In answer to a question put\nto her by a third party the woman said to me: \"They're mine, sir.\"\n\nTHE JUDGE.  What are?  What were?\n\nCOKESON.  Her children.  They were outside.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  HOW do you know?\n\nCOKESON.  Your lordship mustn't ask me that, or I shall have to tell\nyou what I was told--and that'd never do.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  [Smiling]  The office-boy made a statement.\n\nCOKESON.  Egg-zactly.\n\nFROME.  What I want to ask you, Mr. Cokeson, is this.  In the course\nof her appeal to see Falder, did the woman say anything that you\nspecially remember?\n\nCOKESON.  [Looking at him as if to encourage him to complete the\nsentence]  A leetle more, sir.\n\nFROME.  Or did she not?\n\nCOKESON.  She did.  I shouldn't like you to have led me to the\nanswer.\n\nFROME.  [With an irritated smile]  Will you tell the jury what it\nwas?\n\nCOKESON.  \"It's a matter of life and death.\"\n\nFOREMAN OF THE JURY.  Do you mean the woman said that?\n\nCOKESON.  [Nodding]  It's not the sort of thing you like to have said\nto you.\n\nFROME.  [A little impatiently]  Did Falder come in while she was\nthere?  [COKESON nods]  And she saw him, and went away?\n\nCOKESON.  Ah!  there I can't follow you.  I didn't see her go.\n\nFROME.  Well, is she there now?\n\nCOKESON.  [With an indulgent smile]  No!\n\nFROME.  Thank you, Mr. Cokeson.  [He sits down.]\n\nCLEAVER.  [Rising] You say that on the morning of the forgery the\nprisoner was jumpy.  Well, now, sir, what precisely do you mean by\nthat word?\n\nCOKESON.  [Indulgently]  I want you to understand.  Have you ever\nseen a dog that's lost its master?  He was kind of everywhere at once\nwith his eyes.\n\nCLEAVER.  Thank you; I was coming to his eyes.  You called them\n\"funny.\"  What are we to understand by that?  Strange, or what?\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es, funny.\n\nCOKESON.  [Sharply]  Yes, sir, but what may be funny to you may not\nbe funny to me, or to the jury.  Did they look frightened, or shy, or\nfierce, or what?\n\nCOKESON.  You make it very hard for me.  I give you the word, and you\nwant me to give you another.\n\nCLEAVER.  [Rapping his desk] Does \"funny\" mean mad?\n\nCLEAVER.  Not mad, fun----\n\nCLEAVER.  Very well!  Now you say he had his collar unbuttoned?  Was\nit a hot day?\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es; I think it was.\n\nCLEAVER.  And did he button it when you called his attention to it?\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es, I think he did.\n\nCLEAVER.  Would you say that that denoted insanity?\n\n     He sits downs.  COKESON, who has opened his mouth to reply, is\n     left gaping.\n\nFROME.  [Rising hastily] Have you ever caught him in that dishevelled\nstate before?\n\nCOKESON.  No!  He was always clean and quiet.\n\nFROME.  That will do, thank you.\n\n     COKESON turns blandly to the JUDGE, as though to rebuke counsel\n     for not remembering that the JUDGE might wish to have a chance;\n     arriving at the conclusion that he is to be asked nothing\n     further, he turns and descends from the box, and sits down next\n     to JAMES and WALTER.\n\nFROME.  Ruth Honeywill.\n\n     RUTH comes into court, and takes her stand stoically in the\n     witness-box.  She is sworn.\n\nFROME.  What is your name, please?\n\nRUTH.  Ruth Honeywill.\n\nFROME.  How old are you?\n\nRUTH.  Twenty-six.\n\nFROME.  You are a married woman, living with your husband?  A little\nlouder.\n\nRUTH.  No, sir; not since July.\n\nFROME.  Have you any children?\n\nRUTH.  Yes, sir, two.\n\nFROME.  Are they living with you?\n\nRUTH.  Yes, sir.\n\nFROME.  You know the prisoner?\n\nRUTH. [Looking at him]  Yes.\n\nFROME.  What was the nature of your relations with him?\n\nRUTH.  We were friends.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Friends?\n\nRUTH.  [Simply]  Lovers, sir.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  [Sharply]  In what sense do you use that word?\n\nRUTH.  We love each other.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Yes, but----\n\nRUTH.  [Shaking her head]  No, your lordship--not yet.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  'Not yet!  H'm!  [He looks from RUTH to FALDER]  Well!\n\nFROME.  What is your husband?\n\nRUTH.  Traveller.\n\nFROME.  And what was the nature of your married life?\n\nRUTH.  [Shaking her head]  It don't bear talking about.\n\nFROME.  Did he ill-treat you, or what?\n\nRUTH.  Ever since my first was born.\n\nFROME.  In what way?\n\nRUTH.  I'd rather not say.  All sorts of ways.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  I am afraid I must stop this, you know.\n\nRUTH.  [Pointing to FALDER]  He offered to take me out of it, sir.\nWe were going to South America.\n\nFROME.  [Hastily]  Yes, quite--and what prevented you?\n\nRUTH.  I was outside his office when he was taken away.  It nearly\nbroke my heart.\n\nFROME.  You knew, then, that he had been arrested?\n\nRUTH.  Yes, sir.  I called at his office afterwards, and  [pointing\nto COKESON] that gentleman told me all about it.\n\nFROME.  Now, do you remember the morning of Friday, July 7th?\n\nRUTH.  Yes.\n\nFROME.  Why?\n\nRUTH.  My husband nearly strangled me that morning.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Nearly strangled you!\n\nRUTH.  [Bowing her head] Yes, my lord.\n\nFROME.  With his hands, or----?\n\nRUTH.  Yes, I just managed to get away from him.  I went straight to\nmy friend.  It was eight o'clock.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  In the morning?  Your husband was not under the influence\nof liquor then?\n\nRUTH.  It wasn't always that.\n\nFROME.  In what condition were you?\n\nRUTH.  In very bad condition, sir.  My dress was torn, and I was half\nchoking.\n\nFROME.  Did you tell your friend what had happened?\n\nRUTH.  Yes.  I wish I never had.\n\nFROME.  It upset him?\n\nRUTH.  Dreadfully.\n\nFROME.  Did he ever speak to you about a cheque?\n\nRUTH.  Never.\n\nFROZE.  Did he ever give you any money?\n\nRUTH.  Yes.\n\nFROME.  When was that?\n\nRUTH.  On Saturday.\n\nFROME.  The 8th?\n\nRUTH.  To buy an outfit for me and the children, and get all ready to\nstart.\n\nFROME.  Did that surprise you, or not?\n\nRUTH.  What, sir?\n\nFROME.  That he had money to give you.\n\nRing.  Yes, because on the morning when my husband nearly killed me\nmy friend cried because he hadn't the money to get me away.  He told\nme afterwards he'd come into a windfall.\n\nFROME.  And when did you last see him?\n\nRUTH.  The day he was taken away, sir.  It was the day we were to\nhave started.\n\nFROME.  Oh, yes, the morning of the arrest.  Well, did you see him at\nall between the Friday and that morning?  [RUTH nods]  What was his\nmanner then?\n\nRUTH.  Dumb--like--sometimes he didn't seem able to say a word.\n\nFROME.  As if something unusual had happened to him?\n\nRUTH.  Yes.\n\nFROME.  Painful, or pleasant, or what?\n\nRUTH.  Like a fate hanging over him.\n\nFROME.  [Hesitating]  Tell me, did you love the prisoner very much?\n\nRUTH.  [Bowing her head]  Yes.\n\nFROME.  And had he a very great affection for you?\n\nRUTH.  [Looking at FALDER]  Yes, sir.\n\nFROME.  Now, ma'am, do you or do you not think that your danger and\nunhappiness would seriously affect his balance, his control over his\nactions?\n\nRUTH.  Yes.\n\nFROME.  His reason, even?\n\nRUTH.  For a moment like, I think it would.\n\nFROME.  Was he very much upset that Friday morning, or was he fairly\ncalm?\n\nRUTH.  Dreadfully upset.  I could hardly bear to let him go from me.\n\nFROME.  Do you still love him?\n\nRUTH.  [With her eyes on FALDER]  He's ruined himself for me.\n\nFROME.  Thank you.\n\n     He sits down.  RUTH remains stoically upright in the witness-box.\n\nCLEAVER.  [In a considerate voice]  When you left him on the morning\nof Friday the 7th you would not say that he was out of his mind, I\nsuppose?\n\nRUTH.  No, sir.\n\nCLEAVER.  Thank you; I've no further questions to ask you.\n\nRUTH.  [Bending a little forward to the jury]  I would have done the\nsame for him; I would indeed.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Please, please!  You say your married life is an unhappy\none?  Faults on both sides?\n\nRUTH.  Only that I never bowed down to him.  I don't see why I\nshould, sir, not to a man like that.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  You refused to obey him?\n\nRUTH.  [Avoiding the question]  I've always studied him to keep\nthings nice.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Until you met the prisoner--was that it?\n\nRUTH.  No; even after that.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  I ask, you know, because you seem to me to glory in this\naffection of yours for the prisoner.\n\nRUTH.  [Hesitating]  I--I do.  It's the only thing in my life now.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  [Staring at her hard] Well, step down, please.\n\n     RUTH looks at FALDER, then passes quietly down and takes her\n     seat among the witnesses.\n\nFROME.  I call the prisoner, my lord.\n\n     FALDER leaves the dock; goes into the witness-box, and is duly\n     sworn.\n\nFROME.  What is your name?\n\nFALDER.  William Falder.\n\nFROME.  And age?\n\nFALDER.  Twenty-three.\n\nFROME.  You are not married?\n\n     FALDER shakes his head\n\nFROME.  How long have you known the last witness?\n\nFALDER.  Six months.\n\nFROME.  Is her account of the relationship between you a correct one?\n\nFALDER.  Yes.\n\nFROME.  You became devotedly attached to her, however?\n\nFALDER.  Yes.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Though you knew she was a married woman?\n\nFALDER.  I couldn't help it, your lordship.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Couldn't help it?\n\nFALDER.  I didn't seem able to.\n\n     The JUDGE slightly shrugs his shoulders.\n\nFROME.  How did you come to know her?\n\nFALDER.  Through my married sister.\n\nFROME.  Did you know whether she was happy with her husband?\n\nFALDER.  It was trouble all the time.\n\nFROME.  You knew her husband?\n\nFALDER.  Only through her--he's a brute.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  I can't allow indiscriminate abuse of a person not\npresent.\n\nFROME.  [Bowing]  If your lordship pleases.  [To FALDER]  You admit\naltering this cheque?\n\nFALDER bows his head.\n\nFROME.  Carry your mind, please, to the morning of Friday, July the\n7th, and tell the jury what happened.\n\nFALDER.  [Turning to the jury]  I was having my breakfast when she\ncame.  Her dress was all torn, and she was gasping and couldn't seem\nto get her breath at all; there were the marks of his fingers round\nher throat; her arm was bruised, and the blood had got into her eyes\ndreadfully.  It frightened me, and then when she told me, I felt--I\nfelt--well--it was too much for me!  [Hardening suddenly]  If you'd\nseen it, having the feelings for her that I had, you'd have felt the\nsame, I know.\n\nFROME.  Yes?\n\nFALDER.  When she left me--because I had to go to the office--I was\nout of my senses for fear that he'd do it again, and thinking what I\ncould do.  I couldn't work--all the morning I was like that--simply\ncouldn't fix my mind on anything.  I couldn't think at all.  I seemed\nto have to keep moving.  When Davis--the other clerk--gave me the\ncheque--he said: \"It'll do you good, Will, to have a run with this.\nYou seem half off your chump this morning.\"  Then when I had it in my\nhand--I don't know how it came, but it just flashed across me that if\nI put the 'ty' and the nought there would be the money to get her\naway.  It just came and went--I never thought of it again.  Then\nDavis went out to his luncheon, and I don't really remember what I\ndid till I'd pushed the cheque through to the cashier under the rail.\nI remember his saying \"Gold or notes?\"  Then I suppose I knew what\nI'd done.  Anyway, when I got outside I wanted to chuck myself under\na bus; I wanted to throw the money away; but it seemed I was in for\nit, so I thought at any rate I'd save her.  Of course the tickets I\ntook for the passage and the little I gave her's been wasted, and\nall, except what I was obliged to spend myself, I've restored.  I\nkeep thinking over and over however it was I came to do it, and how I\ncan't have it all again to do differently!\n\n     FALDER is silent, twisting his hands before him.\n\nFROME.  How far is it from your office to the bank?\n\nFALDER.  Not more than fifty yards, sir.\n\nFROME.  From the time Davis went out to lunch to the time you cashed\nthe cheque, how long do you say it must have been?\n\nFALDER.  It couldn't have been four minutes, sir, because I ran all\nthe way.\n\nFROME.  During those four minutes you say you remember nothing?\n\nFALDER.  No, sir; only that I ran.\n\nFROME.  Not even adding the 'ty' and the nought?'\n\nFALDER.  No, sir.  I don't really.\n\n     FROME sits down, and CLEAVER rises.\n\nCLEAVER.  But you remember running, do you?\n\nFALDER.  I was all out of breath when I got to the bank.\n\nCLEAVER.  And you don't remember altering the cheque?\n\nFALDER.  [Faintly]  No, sir.\n\nCLEAVER.  Divested of the romantic glamour which my friend is casting\nover the case, is this anything but an ordinary forgery?  Come.\n\nFALDER.  I was half frantic all that morning, sir.\n\nCLEAVER.  Now, now!  You don't deny that the 'ty' and the nought were\nso like the rest of the handwriting as to thoroughly deceive the\ncashier?\n\nFALDER.  It was an accident.\n\nCLEAVER.  [Cheerfully]  Queer sort of accident, wasn't it?  On which\nday did you alter the counterfoil?\n\nFALDER.  [Hanging his head]  On the Wednesday morning.\n\nCLEAVER.  Was that an accident too?\n\nFALDER.  [Faintly]  No.\n\nCLEAVER.  To do that you had to watch your opportunity, I suppose?\n\nFALDER.  [Almost inaudibly] Yes.\n\nCLEAVER.  You don't suggest that you were suffering under great\nexcitement when you did that?\n\nFALDER.  I was haunted.\n\nCLEAVER.  With the fear of being found out?\n\nFALDER.  [Very low] Yes.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Didn't it occur to you that the only thing for you to do\nwas to confess to your employers, and restore the money?\n\nFALDER.  I was afraid. [There is silence]\n\nCLEAVER.  You desired, too, no doubt, to complete your design of\ntaking this woman away?\n\nFALDER.  When I found I'd done a thing like that, to do it for\nnothing seemed so dreadful.  I might just as well have chucked myself\ninto the river.\n\nCLEAVER.  You knew that the clerk Davis was about to leave England\n--didn't it occur to you when you altered this cheque that suspicion\nwould fall on him?\n\nFALDER.  It was all done in a moment.  I thought of it afterwards.\n\nCLEAVER.  And that didn't lead you to avow what you'd done?\n\nFALDER.  [Sullenly]  I meant to write when I got out there--I would\nhave repaid the money.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  But in the meantime your innocent fellow clerk might have\nbeen prosecuted.\n\nFALDER.  I knew he was a long way off, your lordship.  I thought\nthere'd be time.  I didn't think they'd find it out so soon.\n\nFROME.  I might remind your lordship that as Mr. Walter How had the\ncheque-book in his pocket till after Davis had sailed, if the\ndiscovery had been made only one day later Falder himself would have\nleft, and suspicion would have attached to him, and not to Davis,\nfrom the beginning.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  The question is whether the prisoner knew that suspicion\nwould light on himself, and not on Davis.  [To FALDER sharply] Did\nyou know that Mr. Walter How had the cheque-book till after Davis\nhad sailed?\n\nFALDER.  I--I--thought--he----\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Now speak the truth-yes or no!\n\nFALDER.  [Very low]  No, my lord.  I had no means of knowing.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  That disposes of your point, Mr. Frome.\n\n     [FROME bows to the JUDGE]\n\nCLEAVER.  Has any aberration of this nature ever attacked you before?\n\nFALDER.  [Faintly]  No, sir.\n\nCLEAVER.  You had recovered sufficiently to go back to your work that\nafternoon?\n\nFALDER.  Yes, I had to take the money back.\n\nCLEAVER.  You mean the nine pounds.  Your wits were sufficiently keen\nfor you to remember that?  And you still persist in saying you don't\nremember altering this cheque.  [He sits down]\n\nFALDER.  If I hadn't been mad I should never have had the courage.\n\nFROME.  [Rising]  Did you have your lunch before going back?\n\nFALDER.  I never ate a thing all day; and at night I couldn't sleep.\n\nFROME.  Now, as to the four minutes that elapsed between Davis's\ngoing out and your cashing the cheque: do you say that you recollect\nnothing during those four minutes?\n\nFALDER.  [After a moment] I remember thinking of Mr. Cokeson's face.\n\nFROME.  Of Mr. Cokeson's face!  Had that any connection with what you\nwere doing?\n\nFALDER.  No, Sir.\n\nFROME.  Was that in the office, before you ran out?\n\nFALDER.  Yes, and while I was running.\n\nFROME.  And that lasted till the cashier said: \"Will you have gold or\nnotes?\"\n\nFALDER.  Yes, and then I seemed to come to myself--and it was too\nlate.\n\nFROME.  Thank you.  That closes the evidence for the defence, my\nlord.\n\n     The JUDGE nods, and FALDER goes back to his seat in the dock.\n\nFROME.  [Gathering up notes]  If it please your lordship--Gentlemen\nof the Jury,--My friend in cross-examination has shown a disposition\nto sneer at the defence which has been set up in this case, and I am\nfree to admit that nothing I can say will move you, if the evidence\nhas not already convinced you that the prisoner committed this act in\na moment when to all practical intents and purposes he was not\nresponsible for his actions; a moment of such mental and moral\nvacuity, arising from the violent emotional agitation under which he\nhad been suffering, as to amount to temporary madness.  My friend has\nalluded to the \"romantic glamour\" with which I have sought to invest\nthis case.  Gentlemen, I have done nothing of the kind.  I have\nmerely shown you the background of \"life\"--that palpitating life\nwhich, believe me--whatever my friend may say--always lies behind the\ncommission of a crime.  Now gentlemen, we live in a highly, civilized\nage, and the sight of brutal violence disturbs us in a very strange\nway, even when we have no personal interest in the matter.  But when\nwe see it inflicted on a woman whom we love--what then?  Just think\nof what your own feelings would have been, each of you, at the\nprisoner's age; and then look at him.  Well!  he is hardly the\ncomfortable, shall we say bucolic, person likely to contemplate with\nequanimity marks of gross violence on a woman to whom he was\ndevotedly attached.  Yes, gentlemen, look at him!  He has not a\nstrong face; but neither has he a vicious face.  He is just the sort\nof man who would easily become the prey of his emotions.  You have\nheard the description of his eyes.  My friend may laugh at the word\n\"funny\"--I think it better describes the peculiar uncanny look of\nthose who are strained to breaking-point than any other word which\ncould have been used.  I don't pretend, mind you, that his mental\nirresponsibility--was more than a flash of darkness, in which all\nsense of proportion became lost; but to contend, that, just as a man\nwho destroys himself at such a moment may be, and often is, absolved\nfrom the stigma attaching to the crime of self-murder, so he may, and\nfrequently does, commit other crimes while in this irresponsible\ncondition, and that he may as justly be acquitted of criminal intent\nand treated as a patient.  I admit that this is a plea which might\nwell be abused.  It is a matter for discretion.  But here you have a\ncase in which there is every reason to give the benefit of the doubt.\nYou heard me ask the prisoner what he thought of during those four\nfatal minutes.  What was his answer?  \"I thought of Mr. Cokeson's\nface!\"  Gentlemen, no man could invent an answer like that; it is\nabsolutely stamped with truth.  You have seen the great affection\n[legitimate or not] existing between him and this woman, who came\nhere to give evidence for him at the risk of her life.  It is\nimpossible for you to doubt his distress on the morning when he\ncommitted this act.  We well know what terrible havoc such distress\ncan make in weak and highly nervous people.  It was all the work of a\nmoment.  The rest has followed, as death follows a stab to the heart,\nor water drops if you hold up a jug to empty it.  Believe me,\ngentlemen, there is nothing more tragic in life than the utter\nimpossibility of changing what you have done.  Once this cheque was\naltered and presented, the work of four minutes--four mad minutes\n--the rest has been silence.  But in those four minutes the boy\nbefore you has slipped through a door, hardly opened, into that great\ncage which never again quite lets a man go--the cage of the Law.  His\nfurther acts, his failure to confess, the alteration of the\ncounterfoil, his preparations for flight, are all evidence--not of\ndeliberate and guilty intention when he committed the prime act from\nwhich these subsequent acts arose; no--they are merely evidence of\nthe weak character which is clearly enough his misfortune.  But is a\nman to be lost because he is bred and born with a weak character?\nGentlemen, men like the prisoner are destroyed daily under our law\nfor want of that human insight which sees them as they are, patients,\nand not criminals.  If the prisoner be found guilty, and treated as\nthough he were a criminal type, he will, as all experience shows, in\nall probability become one.  I beg you not to return a verdict that\nmay thrust him back into prison and brand him for ever.  Gentlemen,\nJustice is a machine that, when some one has once given it the\nstarting push, rolls on of itself.  Is this young man to be ground to\npieces under this machine for an act which at the worst was one of\nweakness?  Is he to become a member of the luckless crews that man\nthose dark, ill-starred ships called prisons?  Is that to be his\nvoyage-from which so few return?  Or is he to have another chance, to\nbe still looked on as one who has gone a little astray, but who will\ncome back?  I urge you, gentlemen, do not ruin this young man!  For,\nas a result of those four minutes, ruin, utter and irretrievable,\nstares him in the face.  He can be saved now.  Imprison him as a\ncriminal, and I affirm to you that he will be lost.  He has neither\nthe face nor the manner of one who can survive that terrible ordeal.\nWeigh in the scales his criminality and the suffering he has\nundergone.  The latter is ten times heavier already.  He has lain in\nprison under this charge for more than two months.  Is he likely ever\nto forget that?  Imagine the anguish of his mind during that time.\nHe has had his punishment, gentlemen, you may depend.  The rolling of\nthe chariot-wheels of Justice over this boy began when it was decided\nto prosecute him.  We are now already at the second stage.  If you\npermit it to go on to the third I would not give--that for him.\n\n     He holds up finger and thumb in the form of a circle, drops his\n     hand, and sits dozen.\n\nThe jury stir, and consult each other's faces; then they turn towards\nthe counsel for the Crown, who rises, and, fixing his eyes on a spot\nthat seems to give him satisfaction, slides them every now and then\ntowards the jury.\n\nCLEAVER.  May it please your lordship--[Rising on his toes] Gentlemen\nof the Jury,--The facts in this case are not disputed, and the\ndefence, if my friend will allow me to say so, is so thin that I\ndon't propose to waste the time of the Court by taking you over the\nevidence.  The plea is one of temporary insanity.  Well, gentlemen, I\ndaresay it is clearer to me than it is to you why this rather--what\nshall we call it?--bizarre defence has been set up.  The alternative\nwould have been to plead guilty.  Now, gentlemen, if the prisoner had\npleaded guilty my friend would have had to rely on a simple appeal to\nhis lordship.  Instead of that, he has gone into the byways and\nhedges and found this--er--peculiar plea, which has enabled him to\nshow you the proverbial woman, to put her in the box--to give, in\nfact, a romantic glow to this affair.  I compliment my friend; I\nthink it highly ingenious of him.  By these means, he has--to a\ncertain extent--got round the Law.  He has brought the whole story of\nmotive and stress out in court, at first hand, in a way that he would\nnot otherwise have been able to do.  But when you have once grasped\nthat fact, gentlemen, you have grasped everything.  [With\ngood-humoured contempt]  For look at this plea of insanity; we can't\nput it lower than that.  You have heard the woman.  She has every\nreason to favour the prisoner, but what did she say?  She said that\nthe prisoner was not insane when she left him in the morning.  If he\nwere going out of his mind through distress, that was obviously the\nmoment when insanity would have shown itself.  You have heard the\nmanaging clerk, another witness for the defence.  With some\ndifficulty I elicited from him the admission that the prisoner,\nthough jumpy [a word that he seemed to think you would understand,\ngentlemen, and I'm sure I hope you do], was not mad when the cheque\nwas handed to Davis.  I agree with my friend that it's unfortunate\nthat we have not got Davis here, but the prisoner has told you the\nwords with which Davis in turn handed him the cheque; he obviously,\ntherefore, was not mad when he received it, or he would not have\nremembered those words.  The cashier has told you that he was\ncertainly in his senses when he cashed it.  We have therefore the\nplea that a man who is sane at ten minutes past one, and sane at\nfifteen minutes past, may, for the purposes of avoiding the\nconsequences of a crime, call himself insane between those points of\ntime.  Really, gentlemen, this is so peculiar a proposition that I am\nnot disposed to weary you with further argument.  You will form your\nown opinion of its value.  My friend has adopted this way of saying a\ngreat deal to you--and very eloquently--on the score of youth,\ntemptation, and the like.  I might point out, however, that the\noffence with which the prisoner is charged is one of the most serious\nknown to our law; and there are certain features in this case, such\nas the suspicion which he allowed to rest on his innocent fellow-clerk,\nand his relations with this married woman, which will render it\ndifficult for you to attach too much importance to such pleading. I\nask you, in short, gentlemen, for that verdict of guilty which, in the\ncircumstances, I regard you as, unfortunately, bound to record.\n\n     Letting his eyes travel from the JUDGE and the jury to FROME, he\n     sits down.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  [Bending a little towards the jury, and speaking in a\nbusiness-like voice]  Gentlemen, you have heard the evidence, and the\ncomments on it.  My only business is to make clear to you the issues\nyou have to try.  The facts are admitted, so far as the alteration of\nthis cheque and counterfoil by the prisoner.  The defence set up is\nthat he was not in a responsible condition when he committed the\ncrime.  Well, you have heard the prisoner's story, and the evidence\nof the other witnesses--so far as it bears on the point of insanity.\nIf you think that what you have heard establishes the fact that the\nprisoner was insane at the time of the forgery, you will find him\nguilty, but insane.  If, on the other hand, you conclude from what\nyou have seen and heard that the prisoner was sane--and nothing short\nof insanity will count--you will find him guilty.  In reviewing the\ntestimony as to his mental condition you must bear in mind very\ncarefully the evidence as to his demeanour and conduct both before\nand after the act of forgery--the evidence of the prisoner himself,\nof the woman, of the witness--er--COKESON, and--er--of the cashier.\nAnd in regard to that I especially direct your attention to the\nprisoner's admission that the idea of adding the 'ty' and the nought\ndid come into his mind at the moment when the cheque was handed to\nhim; and also to the alteration of the counterfoil, and to his\nsubsequent conduct generally.  The bearing of all this on the\nquestion of premeditation [and premeditation will imply sanity] is\nvery obvious.  You must not allow any considerations of age or\ntemptation to weigh with you in the finding of your verdict.  Before\nyou can come to a verdict of guilty but insane you must be well and\nthoroughly convinced that the condition of his mind was such as would\nhave qualified him at the moment for a lunatic asylum.  [He pauses,\nthen, seeing that the jury are doubtful whether to retire or no,\nadds:] You may retire, gentlemen, if you wish to do so.\n\n     The jury retire by a door behind the JUDGE.  The JUDGE bends\n     over his notes.  FALDER, leaning from the dock, speaks excitedly\n     to his solicitor, pointing dawn at RUTH.  The solicitor in turn\n     speaks to FROME.\n\nFROME.  [Rising] My lord.  The prisoner is very anxious that I should\nask you if your lordship would kindly request the reporters not to\ndisclose the name of the woman witness in the Press reports of these\nproceedings.  Your lordship will understand that the consequences\nmight be extremely serious to her.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  [Pointedly--with the suspicion of a smile]  well, Mr.\nFrome, you deliberately took this course which involved bringing her\nhere.\n\nFROME. [With an ironic bow]  If your lordship thinks I could have\nbrought out the full facts in any other way?\n\nTHE JUDGE.  H'm!  Well.\n\nFROME.  There is very real danger to her, your lordship.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  You see, I have to take your word for all that.\n\nFROME.  If your lordship would be so kind.  I can assure your\nlordship that I am not exaggerating.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  It goes very much against the grain with me that the name\nof a witness should ever be suppressed.  [With a glance at FALDER,\nwho is gripping and clasping his hands before him, and then at RUTH,\nwho is sitting perfectly rigid with her eyes fixed on FALDER]  I'll\nconsider your application.  It must depend.  I have to remember that\nshe may have come here to commit perjury on the prisoner's behalf.\n\nFROME.  Your lordship, I really----\n\nTHE JUDGE.  Yes, yes--I don't suggest anything of the sort, Mr.\nFrome.  Leave it at that for the moment.\n\n     As he finishes speaking, the jury return, and file back into the\n     box.\n\nCLERK of ASSIZE.  Gentlemen, are you agreed on your verdict?\n\nFOREMAN.  We are.\n\nCLERK of ASSIZE.  Is it Guilty, or Guilty but insane?\n\nFOREMAN.  Guilty.\n\n     The JUDGE nods; then, gathering up his notes, sits looking at\n     FALDER, who stands motionless.\n\nFROME.  [Rising] If your lordship would allow me to address you in\nmitigation of sentence.  I don't know if your lordship thinks I can\nadd anything to what I have said to the jury on the score of the\nprisoner's youth, and the great stress under which he acted.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  I don't think you can, Mr. Frome.\n\nFROME.  If your lordship says so--I do most earnestly beg your\nlordship to give the utmost weight to my plea.  [He sits down.]\n\nTHE JUDGE.  [To the CLERK] Call upon him.\n\nTHE CLERK.  Prisoner at the bar, you stand convicted of felony.  Have\nyou anything to say for yourself, why the Court should not give you\njudgment according to law?  [FALDER shakes his head]\n\nTHE JUDGE.  William Falder, you have been given fair trial and found\nguilty, in my opinion rightly found guilty, of forgery.  [He pauses;\nthen, consulting his notes, goes on]  The defence was set up that you\nwere not responsible for your actions at the moment of committing\nthis crime.  There is no, doubt, I think, that this was a device to\nbring out at first hand the nature of the temptation to which you\nsuccumbed.  For throughout the trial your counsel was in reality\nmaking an appeal for mercy.  The setting up of this defence of course\nenabled him to put in some evidence that might weigh in that\ndirection.  Whether he was well advised to so is another matter.  He\nclaimed that you should be treated rather as a patient than as a\ncriminal.  And this plea of his, which in the end amounted to a\npassionate appeal, he based in effect on an indictment of the march\nof Justice, which he practically accused of confirming and completing\nthe process of criminality.  Now, in considering how far I should\nallow weight to his appeal; I have a number of factors to take into\naccount.  I have to consider on the one hand the grave nature of your\noffence, the deliberate way in which you subsequently altered the\ncounterfoil, the danger you caused to an innocent man--and that, to\nmy mind, is a very grave point--and finally I have to consider the\nnecessity of deterring others from following your example.  On the\nother hand, I have to bear in mind that you are young, that you have\nhitherto borne a good character, that you were, if I am to believe\nyour evidence and that of your witnesses, in a state of some\nemotional excitement when you committed this crime.  I have every\nwish, consistently with my duty--not only to you, but to the\ncommunity--to treat you with leniency.  And this brings me to what\nare the determining factors in my mind in my consideration of your\ncase.  You are a clerk in a lawyer's office--that is a very serious\nelement in this case; there can be no possible excuse made for you on\nthe ground that you were not fully conversant with the nature of the\ncrime you were committing, and the penalties that attach to it.  It\nis said, however, that you were carried away by your emotions.  The\nstory has been told here to-day of your relations with this--er--Mrs.\nHoneywill; on that story both the defence and the plea for mercy were\nin effect based.  Now what is that story?  It is that you, a young\nman, and she, a young woman, unhappily married, had formed an\nattachment, which you both say--with what truth I am unable to gauge\n--had not yet resulted in immoral relations, but which you both admit\nwas about to result in such relationship.  Your counsel has made an\nattempt to palliate this, on the ground that the woman is in what he\ndescribes, I think, as \"a hopeless position.\"  As to that I can\nexpress no opinion.  She is a married woman, and the fact is patent\nthat you committed this crime with the view of furthering an immoral\ndesign.  Now, however I might wish, I am not able to justify to my\nconscience a plea for mercy which has a basis inimical to morality.\nIt is vitiated 'ab initio', and would, if successful, free you for\nthe completion of this immoral project.  Your counsel has made an\nattempt to trace your offence back to what he seems to suggest is a\ndefect in the marriage law; he has made an attempt also to show that\nto punish you with further imprisonment would be unjust.  I do not\nfollow him in these flights.  The Law is what it is--a majestic\nedifice, sheltering all of us, each stone of which rests on another.\nI am concerned only with its administration.  The crime you have\ncommitted is a very serious one.  I cannot feel it in accordance with\nmy duty to Society to exercise the powers I have in your favour.  You\nwill go to penal servitude for three years.\n\n     FALDER, who throughout the JUDGE'S speech has looked at him\n     steadily, lets his head fall forward on his breast.  RUTH starts\n     up from her seat as he is taken out by the warders.  There is a\n     bustle in court.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  [Speaking to the reporters] Gentlemen of the Press, I\nthink that the name of the female witness should not be reported.\n\n     The reporters bow their acquiescence.  THE JUDGE.  [To RUTH, who\n     is staring in the direction in which FALDER has disappeared] Do\n     you understand, your name will not be mentioned?\n\nCOKESON.  [Pulling her sleeve]  The judge is speaking to you.\n\n     RUTH turns, stares at the JUDGE, and turns away.\n\nTHE JUDGE.  I shall sit rather late to-day.  Call the next case.\n\nCLERK of ASSIZE.  [To a warder]  Put up John Booley.\n\n     To cries of \"Witnesses in the case of Booley\":\n\n\n                    The curtain falls.\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\nSCENE I\n\n     A prison.  A plainly furnished room, with two large barred\n     windows, overlooking the prisoners' exercise yard, where men, in\n     yellow clothes marked with arrows, and yellow brimless caps, are\n     seen in single file at a distance of four yards from each other,\n     walking rapidly on serpentine white lines marked on the concrete\n     floor of the yard.  Two warders in blue uniforms, with peaked\n     caps and swords, are stationed amongst them.  The room has\n     distempered walls, a bookcase with numerous official-looking\n     books, a cupboard between the windows, a plan of the prison on\n     the wall, a writing-table covered with documents.  It is\n     Christmas Eve.\n\n     The GOVERNOR, a neat, grave-looking man, with a trim, fair\n     moustache, the eyes of a theorist, and grizzled hair, receding\n     from the temples, is standing close to this writing-table\n     looking at a sort of rough saw made out of a piece of metal.\n     The hand in which he holds it is gloved, for two fingers\n     are missing.  The chief warder, WOODER, a tall, thin,\n     military-looking man of sixty, with grey moustache and\n     melancholy, monkey-like eyes, stands very upright two paces\n     from him.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [With a faint, abstracted smile]  Queer-looking\naffair, Mr. Wooder!  Where did you find it?\n\nWOODER.  In his mattress, sir.  Haven't come across such a thing for\ntwo years now.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [With curiosity] Had he any set plan?\n\nWOODER.  He'd sawed his window-bar about that much.  [He holds up his\nthumb and finger a quarter of an inch apart]\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  I'll see him this afternoon.  What's his name?\nMoaney!  An old hand, I think?\n\nWOODER.  Yes, sir-fourth spell of penal.  You'd think an old lag like\nhim would have had more sense by now.  [With pitying contempt]\nOccupied his mind, he said.  Breaking in and breaking out--that's all\nthey think about.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Who's next him?\n\nWOODER.  O'Cleary, sir.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  The Irishman.\n\nWOODER.  Next him again there's that young fellow, Falder--star\nclass--and next him old Clipton.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Ah, yes!  \"The philosopher.\"  I want to see him about\nhis eyes.\n\nWOODER.  Curious thing, sir: they seem to know when there's one of\nthese tries at escape going on.  It makes them restive--there's a\nregular wave going through them just now.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Meditatively]  Odd things--those waves.  [Turning to\nlook at the prisoners exercising]  Seem quiet enough out here!\n\nWOODER.  That Irishman, O'Cleary, began banging on his door this\nmorning.  Little thing like that's quite enough to upset the whole\nlot.  They're just like dumb animals at times.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  I've seen it with horses before thunder--it'll run\nright through cavalry lines.\n\n     The prison CHAPLAIN has entered.  He is a dark-haired, ascetic\n     man, in clerical undress, with a peculiarly steady, tight-lipped\n     face and slow, cultured speech.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Holding up the saw]  Seen this, Miller?\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Useful-looking specimen.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Do for the Museum, eh!  [He goes to the cupboard and\nopens it, displaying to view a number of quaint ropes, hooks, and\nmetal tools with labels tied on them]  That'll do, thanks, Mr.\nWooder.\n\nWOODER.  [Saluting]  Thank you, sir.  [He goes out]\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Account for the state of the men last day or two,\nMiller?  Seems going through the whole place.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  No.  I don't know of anything.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  By the way, will you dine with us on Christmas Day?\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  To-morrow.  Thanks very much.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Worries me to feel the men discontented.  [Gazing at\nthe saw]  Have to punish this poor devil.  Can't help liking a man\nwho tries to escape.  [He places the saw in his pocket and locks the\ncupboard again]\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Extraordinary perverted will-power--some of them.\nNothing to be done till it's broken.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  And not much afterwards, I'm afraid.  Ground too hard\nfor golf?\n\n     WOODER comes in again.\n\nWOODER.  Visitor who's been seeing Q 3007 asks to speak to you, sir.\nI told him it wasn't usual.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  What about?\n\nWOODER.  Shall I put him off, sir?\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Resignedly]  No, no.  Let's see him.  Don't go,\nMiller.\n\nWOODER motions to some one without, and as the visitor comes in\nwithdraws.\n\n     The visitor is COKESON, who is attired in a thick overcoat to\n     the knees, woollen gloves, and carries a top hat.\n\nCOKESON.  I'm sorry to trouble you.  I've been talking to the young\nman.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  We have a good many here.\n\nCOKESON.  Name of Falder, forgery.  [Producing a card, and handing it\nto the GOVERNOR]  Firm of James and Walter How.  Well known in the\nlaw.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Receiving the card-with a faint smile]  What do you\nwant to see me about, sir?\n\nCOKESON.  [Suddenly seeing the prisoners at exercise]  Why! what a\nsight!\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Yes, we have that privilege from here; my office is\nbeing done up.  [Sitting down at his table]  Now, please!\n\nCOKESON.  [Dragging his eyes with difficulty from the window] I\nwanted to say a word to you; I shan't keep you long.\n[Confidentially]  Fact is, I oughtn't to be here by rights.  His\nsister came to me--he's got no father and mother--and she was in some\ndistress.  \"My husband won't let me go and see him,\" she said; \"says\nhe's disgraced the family.  And his other sister,\" she said, \"is an\ninvalid.\"  And she asked me to come.  Well, I take an interest in\nhim.  He was our junior--I go to the same chapel--and I didn't like\nto refuse.  And what I wanted to tell you was, he seems lonely here.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Not unnaturally.\n\nCOKESON.  I'm afraid it'll prey on my mind.  I see a lot of them\nabout working together.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Those are local prisoners.  The convicts serve their\nthree months here in separate confinement, sir.\n\nCOKESON.  But we don't want to be unreasonable.  He's quite\ndownhearted.  I wanted to ask you to let him run about with the\nothers.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [With faint amusement]  Ring the bell-would you,\nMiller?  [To COKESON]  You'd like to hear what the doctor says about\nhim, perhaps.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  [Ringing the bell]  You are not accustomed to prisons,\nit would seem, sir.\n\nCOKESON.  No.  But it's a pitiful sight.  He's quite a young fellow.\nI said to him: \"Before a month's up\" I said, \"you'll be out and about\nwith the others; it'll be a nice change for you.\"  \"A month!\" he said\n--like that!  \"Come!\" I said, \"we mustn't exaggerate.  What's a\nmonth?  Why, it's nothing!\"  \"A day,\" he said, \"shut up in your cell\nthinking and brooding as I do, it's longer than a year outside.  I\ncan't help it,\" he said; \"I try--but I'm built that way, Mr.\nCOKESON.\"  And, he held his hand up to his face.  I could see the\ntears trickling through his fingers.  It wasn't nice.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  He's a young man with large, rather peculiar eyes,\nisn't he?  Not Church of England, I think?\n\nCOKESON.  No.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  I know.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [To WOODER, who has come in]  Ask the doctor to be\ngood enough to come here for a minute.  [WOODER salutes, and goes\nout]  Let's see, he's not married?\n\nCOKESON.  No.  [Confidentially]  But there's a party he's very much\nattached to, not altogether com-il-fa.  It's a sad story.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  If it wasn't for drink and women, sir, this prison\nmight be closed.\n\nCOKESON.  [Looking at the CHAPLAIN over his spectacles] Ye-es, but I\nwanted to tell you about that, special.  He had hopes they'd have let\nher come and see him, but they haven't.  Of course he asked me\nquestions.  I did my best, but I couldn't tell the poor young fellow\na lie, with him in here--seemed like hitting him.  But I'm afraid\nit's made him worse.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  What was this news then?\n\nCOKESON.  Like this.  The woman had a nahsty, spiteful feller for a\nhusband, and she'd left him.  Fact is, she was going away with our\nyoung friend.  It's not nice--but I've looked over it.  Well, when he\nwas put in here she said she'd earn her living apart, and wait for\nhim to come out.  That was a great consolation to him.  But after a\nmonth she came to me--I don't know her personally--and she said:\n\"I can't earn the children's living, let alone my own--I've got no\nfriends.  I'm obliged to keep out of everybody's way, else my\nhusband'd get to know where I was.  I'm very much reduced,\" she said.\nAnd she has lost flesh.  \"I'll have to go in the workhouse!\" It's a\npainful story.  I said to her: \"No,\" I said, \"not that!  I've got a\nwife an' family, but sooner than you should do that I'll spare you a\nlittle myself.\"  \"Really,\" she said--she's a nice creature--\"I don't\nlike to take it from you.  I think I'd better go back to my husband.\"\nWell, I know he's a nahsty, spiteful feller--drinks--but I didn't\nlike to persuade her not to.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Surely, no.\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es, but I'm sorry now; it's upset the poor young fellow\ndreadfully.  And what I wanted to say was: He's got his three years\nto serve.  I want things to be pleasant for him.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  [With a touch of impatience] The Law hardly shares\nyour view, I'm afraid.\n\nCOKESON.  But I can't help thinking that to shut him up there by\nhimself'll turn him silly.  And nobody wants that, I s'pose.  I don't\nlike to see a man cry.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  It's a very rare thing for them to give way like that.\n\nCOKESON.  [Looking at him-in a tone of sudden dogged hostility]\nI keep dogs.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Indeed?\n\nCOKESON.  Ye-es.  And I say this: I wouldn't shut one of them up all\nby himself, month after month, not if he'd bit me all over.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Unfortunately, the criminal is not a dog; he has a\nsense of right and wrong.\n\nCOKESON.  But that's not the way to make him feel it.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Ah!  there I'm afraid we must differ.\n\nCOKESON.  It's the same with dogs.  If you treat 'em with kindness\nthey'll do anything for you; but to shut 'em up alone, it only makes\n'em savage.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Surely you should allow those who have had a little\nmore experience than yourself to know what is best for prisoners.\n\nCOKESON.  [Doggedly]  I know this young feller, I've watched him for\nyears.  He's eurotic--got no stamina.  His father died of\nconsumption.  I'm thinking of his future.  If he's to be kept there\nshut up by himself, without a cat to keep him company, it'll do him\nharm.  I said to him: \"Where do you feel it?\"  \"I can't tell you, Mr.\nCOKESON,\" he said, \"but sometimes I could beat my head against the\nwall.\"  It's not nice.\n\n     During this speech the DOCTOR has entered.  He is a\n     medium-Sized, rather good-looking man, with a quick eye.\n     He stands leaning against the window.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  This gentleman thinks the separate is telling on\nQ 3007--Falder, young thin fellow, star class.  What do you say,\nDoctor Clements?\n\nTHE DOCTOR.  He doesn't like it, but it's not doing him any harm.\n\nCOKESON.  But he's told me.\n\nTHE DOCTOR.  Of course he'd say so, but we can always tell.  He's\nlost no weight since he's been here.\n\nCOKESON.  It's his state of mind I'm speaking of.\n\nTHE DOCTOR.  His mind's all right so far.  He's nervous, rather\nmelancholy.  I don't see signs of anything more.  I'm watching him\ncarefully.\n\nCOKESON.  [Nonplussed]  I'm glad to hear you say that.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  [More suavely] It's just at this period that we are\nable to make some impression on them, sir.  I am speaking from my\nspecial standpoint.\n\nCOKESON.  [Turning bewildered to the GOVERNOR] I don't want to be\nunpleasant, but having given him this news, I do feel it's awkward.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  I'll make a point of seeing him to-day.\n\nCOKESON.  I'm much obliged to you.  I thought perhaps seeing him\nevery day you wouldn't notice it.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Rather sharply]  If any sign of injury to his health\nshows itself his case will be reported at once.  That's fully\nprovided for.  [He rises]\n\nCOKESON.  [Following his own thoughts]  Of course, what you don't see\ndoesn't trouble you; but having seen him, I don't want to have him on\nmy mind.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  I think you may safely leave it to us, sir.\n\nCOKESON.  [Mollified and apologetic]  I thought you'd understand me.\nI'm a plain man--never set myself up against authority.  [Expanding\nto the CHAPLAIN]  Nothing personal meant.  Good-morning.\n\n     As he goes out the three officials do not look at each other,\n     but their faces wear peculiar expressions.\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Our friend seems to think that prison is a hospital.\n\nCOKESON.  [Returning suddenly with an apologetic air]  There's just\none little thing.  This woman--I suppose I mustn't ask you to let him\nsee her.  It'd be a rare treat for them both.  He's thinking about\nher all the time.  Of course she's not his wife.  But he's quite safe\nin here.  They're a pitiful couple.  You couldn't make an exception?\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Wearily] As you say, my dear sir, I couldn't make an\nexception; he won't be allowed another visit of any sort till he goes\nto a convict prison.\n\nCOKESON.  I see.  [Rather coldly] Sorry to have troubled you.\n[He again goes out]\n\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  [Shrugging his shoulders]  The plain man indeed, poor\nfellow.  Come and have some lunch, Clements?\n\n\n     He and the DOCTOR go out talking.\n\n     The GOVERNOR, with a sigh, sits down at his table and takes up a\n     pen.\n\n\n                         The curtain falls.\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\n     Part of the ground corridor of the prison.  The walls are\n     coloured with greenish distemper up to a stripe of deeper green\n     about the height of a man's shoulder, and above this line are\n     whitewashed.  The floor is of blackened stones.  Daylight is\n     filtering through a heavily barred window at the end.  The doors\n     of four cells are visible.  Each cell door has a little round\n     peep-hole at the level of a man's eye, covered by a little round\n     disc, which, raised upwards, affords a view o f the cell.  On\n     the wall, close to each cell door, hangs a little square board\n     with the prisoner's name, number, and record.\n\n     Overhead can be seen the iron structures of the first-floor and\n     second-floor corridors.\n\n     The WARDER INSTRUCTOR, a bearded man in blue uniform, with an\n     apron, and some dangling keys, is just emerging from one of the\n     cells.\n\nINSTRUCTOR.  [Speaking from the door into the cell]  I'll have\nanother bit for you when that's finished.\n\nO'CLEARY.  [Unseen--in an Irish voice] Little doubt o' that, sirr.\n\nINSTRUCTOR.  [Gossiping]  Well, you'd rather have it than nothing, I\ns'pose.\n\nO'CLEARY.  An' that's the blessed truth.\n\n     Sounds are heard of a cell door being closed and locked, and of\n     approaching footsteps.\n\nINSTRUCTOR.  [In a sharp, changed voice]  Look alive over it!\n\n     He shuts the cell door, and stands at attention.\n\n     The GOVERNOR comes walking down the corridor, followed by\n     WOODER.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Anything to report?\n\nINSTRUCTOR.  [Saluting]  Q 3007  [he points to a cell]  is behind\nwith his work, sir.  He'll lose marks to-day.\n\n     The GOVERNOR nods and passes on to the end cell.  The INSTRUCTOR\n     goes away.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  This is our maker of saws, isn't it?\n\n     He takes the saw from his pocket as WOODER throws open the door\n     of the cell.  The convict MOANEY is seen lying on his bed,\n     athwart the cell, with his cap on.  He springs up and stands in\n     the middle of the cell.  He is a raw-boned fellow, about\n     fifty-six years old, with outstanding bat's ears and fierce,\n     staring, steel-coloured eyes.\n\nWOODER.  Cap off!  [MOANEY removes his cap] Out here! [MOANEY Comes\nto the door]\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Beckoning him out into the corridor, and holding up\nthe saw--with the manner of an officer speaking to a private]\nAnything to say about this, my man?  [MOANEY is silent]  Come!\n\nMOANEY.  It passed the time.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Pointing into the cell]  Not enough to do, eh?\n\nMOANEY.  It don't occupy your mind.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Tapping the saw]  You might find a better way than\nthis.\n\nMOANEY.  [Sullenly]  Well!  What way?  I must keep my hand in against\nthe time I get out.  What's the good of anything else to me at my\ntime of life?  [With a gradual change to civility, as his tongue\nwarms]  Ye know that, sir.  I'll be in again within a year or two,\nafter I've done this lot.  I don't want to disgrace meself when I'm\nout.  You've got your pride keeping the prison smart; well, I've got\nmine.  [Seeing that the GOVERNOR is listening with interest, he goes\non, pointing to the saw]  I must be doin' a little o' this.  It's no\nharm to any one.  I was five weeks makin' that saw--a bit of all\nright it is, too; now I'll get cells, I suppose, or seven days' bread\nand water.  You can't help it, sir, I know that--I quite put meself\nin your place.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Now, look here, Moaney, if I pass it over will you\ngive me your word not to try it on again?  Think!  [He goes into the\ncell, walks to the end of it, mounts the stool, and tries the\nwindow-bars]\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Returning]  Well?\n\nMOANEY.  [Who has been reflecting] I've got another six weeks to do\nin here, alone.  I can't do it and think o' nothing.  I must have\nsomething to interest me.  You've made me a sporting offer, sir, but\nI can't pass my word about it.  I shouldn't like to deceive a\ngentleman.  [Pointing into the cell] Another four hours' steady work\nwould have done it.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Yes, and what then?  Caught, brought back, punishment.\nFive weeks' hard work to make this, and cells at the end of it, while\nthey put anew bar to your window.  Is it worth it, Moaney?\n\nMOANEY.  [With a sort of fierceness] Yes, it is.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Putting his hand to his brow] Oh, well!  Two days'\ncells-bread and water.\n\nMOANEY.  Thank 'e, sir.\n\n     He turns quickly like an animal and slips into his cell.\n\n     The GOVERNOR looks after him and shakes his head as WOODER\n     closes and locks the cell door.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Open Clipton's cell.\n\n     WOODER opens the door of CLIPTON'S cell.   CLIPTON is sitting on\n     a stool just inside the door, at work on a pair of trousers.  He\n     is a small, thick, oldish man, with an almost shaven head, and\n     smouldering little dark eyes behind smoked spectacles.  He gets\n     up and stands motionless in the doorway, peering at his\n     visitors.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Beckoning] Come out here a minute, Clipton.\n\n     CLIPTON, with a sort of dreadful quietness, comes into the\n     corridor, the needle and thread in his hand.  The GOVERNOR signs\n     to WOODER, who goes into the cell and inspects it carefully.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  How are your eyes?\n\nCLIFTON.  I don't complain of them.  I don't see the sun here.  [He\nmakes a stealthy movement, protruding his neck a little]  There's\njust one thing, Mr. Governor, as you're speaking to me.  I wish you'd\nask the cove next door here to keep a bit quieter.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  What's the matter?  I don't want any tales, Clipton.\n\nCLIPTON.  He keeps me awake.  I don't know who he is.  [With\ncontempt]  One of this star class, I expect.  Oughtn't to be here\nwith us.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Quietly]  Quite right, Clipton.  He'll be moved when\nthere's a cell vacant.\n\nCLIPTON.  He knocks about like a wild beast in the early morning.\nI'm not used to it--stops me getting my sleep out.  In the evening\ntoo.  It's not fair, Mr. Governor, as you're speaking to me.\nSleep's the comfort I've got here; I'm entitled to take it out full.\n\n     WOODER comes out of the cell, and instantly, as though\n     extinguished, CLIPTON moves with stealthy suddenness back into\n     his cell.\n\nWOODER.  All right, sir.\n\n     THE GOVERNOR nods.  The door is closed and locked.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Which is the man who banged on his door this morning?\n\nWOODER.  [Going towards O'CLEARY'S cell]  This one, sir; O'Cleary.\n\n     He lifts the disc and glances through the peephole.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Open.\n\n     WOODER throws open the door.  O'CLEARY, who is seated at a\n     little table by the door as if listening, springs up and stands\n     at attention jest inside the doorway.  He is a broad-faced,\n     middle-aged man, with a wide, thin, flexible mouth, and little\n     holes under his high cheek-bones.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Where's the joke, O'Cleary?\n\nO'CLEARY.  The joke, your honour?  I've not seen one for a long time.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Banging on your door?\n\nO'CLEARY.  Oh! that!\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  It's womanish.\n\nO'CLEARY.  An' it's that I'm becoming this two months past.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Anything to complain of?\n\nO'CLEARY.  NO, Sirr.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You're an old hand; you ought to know better.\n\nO'CLEARY.  Yes, I've been through it all.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You've got a youngster next door; you'll upset him.\n\nO'CLEARY.  It cam' over me, your honour.  I can't always be the same\nsteady man.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Work all right?\n\nO'CLEARY.  [Taking up a rush mat he is making]  Oh! I can do it on me\nhead.  It's the miserablest stuff--don't take the brains of a mouse.\n[Working his mouth]  It's here I feel it--the want of a little noise\n--a terrible little wud ease me.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You know as well as I do that if you were out in the\nshops you wouldn't be allowed to talk.\n\nO'CLEARY.  [With a look of profound meaning]  Not with my mouth.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Well, then?\n\nO'CLEARY.  But it's the great conversation I'd have.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [With a smile] Well, no more conversation on your\ndoor.\n\nO'CLEARY.  No, sirr, I wud not have the little wit to repeat meself.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Turning]  Good-night.\n\nO'CLEARY.  Good-night, your honour.\n\n     He turns into his cell.  The GOVERNOR shuts the door.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Looking at the record card]  Can't help liking the\npoor blackguard.\n\nWOODER.  He's an amiable man, sir.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Pointing down the corridor] Ask the doctor to come\nhere, Mr. Wooder.\n\n     WOODER salutes and goes away down the corridor.\n\n     The GOVERNOR goes to the door of FALDER'S cell.  He raises his\n     uninjured hand to uncover the peep-hole; but, without uncovering\n     it, shakes his head and drops his hand; then, after scrutinising\n     the record board, he opens the cell door.  FALDER, who is\n     standing against it, lurches forward.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Beckoning him out]  Now tell me: can't you settle\ndown, Falder?\n\nFALDER.  [In a breathless voice]  Yes, sir.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You know what I mean?  It's no good running your head\nagainst a stone wall, is it?\n\nFALDER.  No, sir.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Well, come.\n\nFALDER.  I try, sir.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Can't you sleep?\n\nFALDER.  Very little.  Between two o'clock and getting up's the worst\ntime.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  How's that?\n\nFALDER.  [His lips twitch with a sort of smile] I don't know, sir.  I\nwas always nervous.  [Suddenly voluble]  Everything seems to get such\na size then.  I feel I'll never get out as long as I live.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  That's morbid, my lad.  Pull yourself together.\n\nFALDER.  [With an equally sudden dogged resentment] Yes--I've got to.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Think of all these other fellows?\n\nFALDER.  They're used to it.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  They all had to go through it once for the first time,\njust as you're doing now.\n\nFALDER.  Yes, sir, I shall get to be like them in time, I suppose.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Rather taken aback]  H'm!  Well!  That rests with\nyou.  Now come.  Set your mind to it, like a good fellow.  You're\nstill quite young.  A man can make himself what he likes.\n\nFALDER.  [Wistfully] Yes, sir.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Take a good hold of yourself.  Do you read?\n\nFALDER.  I don't take the words in.  [Hanging his head] I know it's\nno good; but I can't help thinking of what's going on outside.  In my\ncell I can't see out at all.  It's thick glass, sir.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You've had a visitor.  Bad news?\n\nFALDER.  Yes.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You mustn't think about it.\n\nFALDER.  [Looking back at his cell]  How can I help it, sir?\n\n     He suddenly becomes motionless as WOODER and the DOCTOR\n     approach.  The GOVERNOR motions to him to go back into his cell.\n\nFALDER.  [Quick and low]  I'm quite right in my head, sir.  [He goes\nback into his cell.]\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [To the DOCTOR]  Just go in and see him, Clements.\n\n     The DOCTOR goes into the cell.  The GOVERNOR pushes the door to,\n     nearly closing it, and walks towards the window.\n\nWOODER.  [Following]  Sorry you should be troubled like this, sir.\nVery contented lot of men, on the whole.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Shortly]  You think so?\n\nWOODER.  Yes, sir.  It's Christmas doing it, in my opinion.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [To himself]  Queer, that!\n\nWOODER.  Beg pardon, sir?\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Christmas!\n\n     He turns towards the window, leaving WOODER looking at him with\n     a sort of pained anxiety.\n\nWOODER.  [Suddenly]  Do you think we make show enough, sir?  If you'd\nlike us to have more holly?\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Not at all, Mr. Wooder.\n\nWOODER.  Very good, sir.\n\n     The DOCTOR has come out of FALDER's Cell, and the GOVERNOR\n     beckons to him.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Well?\n\nTHE DOCTOR.  I can't make anything much of him.  He's nervous, of\ncourse.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Is there any sort of case to report?  Quite frankly,\nDoctor.\n\nTHE DOCTOR.  Well, I don't think the separates doing him any good;\nbut then I could say the same of a lot of them--they'd get on better\nin the shops, there's no doubt.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You mean you'd have to recommend others?\n\nTHE DOCTOR.  A dozen at least.  It's on his nerves.  There's nothing\ntangible.  That fellow there [pointing to O'CLEARY'S cell], for\ninstance--feels it just as much, in his way.  If I once get away from\nphysical facts--I shan't know where I am.  Conscientiously, sir, I\ndon't know how to differentiate him.  He hasn't lost weight.  Nothing\nwrong with his eyes.  His pulse is good.  Talks all right.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  It doesn't amount to melancholia?\n\nTHE DOCTOR.  [Shaking his head]  I can report on him if you like; but\nif I do I ought to report on others.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  I see.  [Looking towards FALDER'S cell]  The poor\ndevil must just stick it then.\n\n     As he says thin he looks absently at WOODER.\n\nWOODER.  Beg pardon, sir?\n\n     For answer the GOVERNOR stares at him, turns on his heel, and\n     walks away.  There is a sound as of beating on metal.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Stopping]  Mr. Wooder?\n\nWOODER.  Banging on his door, sir.  I thought we should have more of\nthat.\n\n     He hurries forward, passing the GOVERNOR, who follows closely.\n\n\n                         The curtain falls.\n\n\n\nSCENE III\n\n     FALDER's cell, a whitewashed space thirteen feet broad by seven\n     deep, and nine feet high, with a rounded  ceiling.  The floor is\n     of shiny blackened bricks.  The barred window of opaque glass,\n     with a ventilator, is high up in the middle of the end wall.  In\n     the middle of the opposite end wall is the narrow door.  In a\n     corner are the mattress and bedding rolled up [two blankets, two\n     sheets, and a coverlet].  Above them is a quarter-circular\n     wooden shelf, on which is a Bible and several little devotional\n     books, piled in a symmetrical pyramid; there are also a black\n     hair brush, tooth-brush, and a bit of soap.  In another corner\n     is the wooden frame of a bed, standing on end.  There is a dark\n     ventilator under the window, and another over the door.\n     FALDER'S work [a shirt to which he is putting buttonholes] is\n     hung to a nail on the wall over a small wooden table, on which\n     the novel \"Lorna Doone\" lies open.  Low down in the corner by\n     the door is a thick glass screen, about a foot square, covering\n     the gas-jet let into the wall. There is also a wooden stool, and\n     a pair of shoes beneath it.  Three bright round tins are set\n     under the window.\n\n     In fast-failing daylight, FALDER, in his stockings, is seen\n     standing motionless, with his head inclined towards the door,\n     listening.  He moves a little closer to the door, his stockinged\n     feet making no noise.  He stops at the door.  He is trying\n     harder and harder to hear something, any little thing that is\n     going on outside.  He springs suddenly upright--as if at a\n     sound-and remains perfectly motionless.  Then, with a heavy\n     sigh, he moves to his work, and stands looking at it, with his\n     head doom; he does a stitch or two, having the air of a man so\n     lost in sadness that each stitch is, as it were, a coming to\n     life.  Then turning abruptly, he begins pacing the cell, moving\n     his head, like an animal pacing its cage.  He stops again at the\n     door, listens, and, placing the palms of hip hands against it\n     with his fingers spread out, leans his forehead against the\n     iron.  Turning from it, presently, he moves slowly back towards\n     the window, tracing his way with his finger along the top line\n     of the distemper that runs round the wall.  He stops under the\n     window, and, picking up the lid of one of the tins, peers into\n     it.  It has grown very nearly dark.  Suddenly the lid falls out\n     of his hand with a clatter--the only sound that has broken the\n     silence--and he stands staring intently at the wall where the\n     stuff of the shirt is hanging rather white in the darkness--he\n     seems to be seeing somebody or something there.  There is a\n     sharp tap and click; the cell light behind the glass screen has\n     been turned up.  The cell is brightly lighted.  FALDER is seen\n     gasping for breath.\n\n     A sound from far away, as of distant, dull beating on thick\n     metal, is suddenly audible.  FALDER shrinks back, not able to\n     bear this sudden clamour.  But the sound grows, as though some\n     great tumbril were rolling towards the cell.  And gradually it\n     seems to hypnotise him.  He begins creeping inch by inch\n     nearer to the door.  The banging sound, travelling from cell to\n     cell, draws closer and closer; FALDER'S hands are seen moving as\n     if his spirit had already joined in this beating, and the sound\n     swells till it seems to have entered the very cell.  He suddenly\n     raises his clenched fists.  Panting violently, he flings himself\n     at his door, and beats on it.\n\n\n                         The curtain falls.\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\n     The scene is again COKESON'S room, at a few minutes to ten of a\n     March morning, two years later.  The doors are all open.\n     SWEEDLE, now blessed with a sprouting moustache, is getting the\n     offices ready.  He arranges papers on COKESON'S table; then goes\n     to a covered washstand, raises the lid, and looks at himself in\n     the mirror.  While he is gazing his full RUTH HONEYWILL comes in\n     through the outer office and stands in the doorway.  There seems\n     a kind of exultation and excitement behind her habitual\n     impassivity.\n\nSWEEDLE.  [Suddenly seeing her, and dropping the lid of the washstand\nwith a bang] Hello!  It's you!\n\nRUTH.  Yes.\n\nSWEEDLE.  There's only me here!  They don't waste their time hurrying\ndown in the morning.  Why, it must be two years since we had the\npleasure of seeing you.  [Nervously]  What have you been doing with\nyourself?\n\nRUTH.  [Sardonically] Living.\n\nSWEEDLE.  [Impressed]  If you want to see him [he points to COKESON'S\nchair], he'll be here directly--never misses--not much.  [Delicately]\nI hope our friend's back from the country.  His time's been up these\nthree months, if I remember.  [RUTH nods] I was awful sorry about\nthat.  The governor made a mistake--if you ask me.\n\nRUTH.  He did.\n\nSWEEDLE.  He ought to have given him a chanst.  And, I say, the judge\nought to ha' let him go after that.  They've forgot what human\nnature's like.  Whereas we know. [RUTH gives him a honeyed smile]\n\nSWEEDLE.  They come down on you like a cartload of bricks, flatten\nyou out, and when you don't swell up again they complain of it.  I\nknow 'em--seen a lot of that sort of thing in my time.  [He shakes\nhis head in the plenitude of wisdom]  Why, only the other day the\ngovernor----\n\n     But COKESON has come in through the outer office; brisk with\n     east wind, and decidedly greyer.\n\nCOKESON.  [Drawing off his coat and gloves]  Why! it's you!  [Then\nmotioning SWEEDLE out, and closing the door]  Quite a stranger!  Must\nbe two years.  D'you want to see me?  I can give you a minute.  Sit\ndown!  Family well?\n\nRUTH.  Yes.  I'm not living where I was.\n\nCOKESON.  [Eyeing her askance] I hope things are more comfortable at\nhome.\n\nRUTH.  I couldn't stay with Honeywill, after all.\n\nCOKESON.  You haven't done anything rash, I hope.  I should be sorry\nif you'd done anything rash.\n\nRUTH.  I've kept the children with me.\n\nCOKESON.  [Beginning to feel that things are not so jolly as ha had\nhoped]  Well, I'm glad to have seen you.  You've not heard from the\nyoung man, I suppose, since he came out?\n\nRUTH.  Yes, I ran across him yesterday.\n\nCOKESON.  I hope he's well.\n\nRUTH.  [With sudden fierceness]  He can't get anything to do.  It's\ndreadful to see him.  He's just skin and bone.\n\nCOKESON.  [With genuine concern] Dear me!  I'm sorry to hear that.\n[On his guard again]  Didn't they find him a place when his time was\nup?\n\nRUTH.  He was only there three weeks.  It got out.\n\nCOKESON.  I'm sure I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't like\nto be snubby.\n\nRUTH.  I can't bear his being like that.\n\nCOKESON.  [Scanning her not unprosperous figure] I know his relations\naren't very forthy about him.  Perhaps you can do something for him,\ntill he finds his feet.\n\nRUTH.  Not now.  I could have--but not now.\n\nCOKESON.  I don't understand.\n\nRUTH.  [Proudly]  I've seen him again--that's all over.\n\nCOKESON.  [Staring at her--disturbed]  I'm a family man--I don't want\nto hear anything unpleasant.  Excuse me--I'm very busy.\n\nRUTH.  I'd have gone home to my people in the country long ago, but\nthey've never got over me marrying Honeywill.  I never was waywise,\nMr. Cokeson, but I'm proud.  I was only a girl, you see, when I\nmarried him.  I thought the world of him, of course...  he used\nto come travelling to our farm.\n\nCOKESON.  [Regretfully]  I did hope you'd have got on better, after\nyou saw me.\n\nRUTH.  He used me worse than ever.  He couldn't break my nerve, but I\nlost my health; and then he began knocking the children about.  I\ncouldn't stand that.  I wouldn't go back now, if he were dying.\n\nCOKESON.  [Who has risen and is shifting about as though dodging a\nstream of lava] We mustn't be violent, must we?\n\nRUTH.  [Smouldering]  A man that can't behave better than that--\n[There is silence]\n\nCOKESON.  [Fascinated in spite of himself]  Then there you were!  And\nwhat did you do then?\n\nRUTH.  [With a shrug]  Tried the same as when I left him before...,\nmaking skirts... cheap things.  It was the best I could get, but I\nnever made more than ten shillings a week, buying my own cotton and\nworking all day; I hardly ever got to bed till past twelve.  I kept\nat it for nine months.  [Fiercely]  Well, I'm not fit for that; I\nwasn't made for it.  I'd rather die.\n\nCOKESON.  My dear woman!  We mustn't talk like that.\n\nRUTH.  It was starvation for the children too--after what they'd\nalways had.  I soon got not to care.  I used to be too tired. [She is\nsilent]\n\nCOKESON.  [With fearful curiosity]  Why, what happened then?\n\nRUTH.  [With a laugh] My employer happened then--he's happened ever\nsince.\n\nCOKESON.  Dear!  Oh dear!  I never came across a thing like this.\n\nRUTH.  [Dully] He's treated me all right.  But I've done with that.\n[Suddenly her lips begin to quiver, and she hides them with the back\nof her hand] I never thought I'd see him again, you see.  It was just\na chance I met him by Hyde Park.  We went in there and sat down, and\nhe told me all about himself.  Oh!  Mr. Cokeson, give him another\nchance.\n\nCOKESON.  [Greatly disturbed]  Then you've both lost your livings!\nWhat a horrible position!\n\nRUTH.  If he could only get here--where there's nothing to find out\nabout him!\n\nCOKESON.  We can't have anything derogative to the firm.\n\nRUTH.  I've no one else to go to.\n\nCOKESON.  I'll speak to the partners, but I don't think they'll take\nhim, under the circumstances.  I don't really.\n\nRUTH.  He came with me; he's down there in the street. [She points to\nthe window.]\n\nCOKESON.  [On his dignity] He shouldn't have done that until he's\nsent for.  [Then softening at the look on her face]  We've got a\nvacancy, as it happens, but I can't promise anything.\n\nRUTH.  It would be the saving of him.\n\nCOKESON.  Well, I'll do what I can, but I'm not sanguine.  Now tell\nhim that I don't want him till I see how things are.  Leave your\naddress?  [Repeating her] 83 Mullingar Street?  [He notes it on\nblotting-paper] Good-morning.\n\nRUTH.  Thank you.\n\n     She moves towards the door, turns as if to speak, but does not,\n     and goes away.\n\nCOKESON.  [Wiping his head and forehead with a large white cotton\nhandkerchief] What a business!  [Then looking amongst his papers, he\nsounds his bell.  SWEEDLE answers it]\n\nCOKESON.  Was that young Richards coming here to-day after the\nclerk's place?\n\nSWEEDLE.  Yes.\n\nCOKESON.  Well, keep him in the air; I don't want to see him yet.\n\nSWEEDLE.  What shall I tell him, sir?\n\nCOKESON.  [With asperity] invent something.  Use your brains.  Don't\nstump him off altogether.\n\nSWEEDLE.  Shall I tell him that we've got illness, sir?\n\nCOKESON.  No!  Nothing untrue.  Say I'm not here to-day.\n\nSWEEDLE.  Yes, sir.  Keep him hankering?\n\nCOKESON.  Exactly.  And look here.  You remember Falder?  I may be\nhaving him round to see me.  Now, treat him like you'd have him treat\nyou in a similar position.\n\nSWEEDLE.  I naturally should do.\n\nCOKESON.  That's right.  When a man's down never hit 'im.  'Tisn't\nnecessary.  Give him a hand up.  That's a metaphor I recommend to you\nin life.  It's sound policy.\n\nSWEEDLE.  Do you think the governors will take him on again, sir?\n\nCOKESON.  Can't say anything about that.  [At the sound of some one\nhaving entered the outer office]  Who's there?\n\nSWEEDLE.  [Going to the door and looking] It's Falder, sir.\n\nCOKESON.  [Vexed]  Dear me!  That's very naughty of her.  Tell him to\ncall again.  I don't want----\n\n     He breaks off as FALDER comes in.  FALDER is thin, pale, older,\n     his eyes have grown more restless.  His clothes are very worn\n     and loose.\n\n     SWEEDLE, nodding cheerfully, withdraws.\n\nCOKESON.  Glad to see you.  You're rather previous.  [Trying to keep\nthings pleasant]  Shake hands!  She's striking while the iron's hot.\n[He wipes his forehead] I don't blame her.  She's anxious.\n\n     FALDER  timidly takes COKESON's hand and glances towards the\n     partners' door.\n\nCOKESON.  No--not yet!  Sit down!  [FALDER sits in the chair at the\naide of COKESON's table, on which he places his cap]  Now you are\nhere I'd like you to give me a little account of yourself.  [Looking\nat him over his spectacles]  How's your health?\n\nFALDER.  I'm alive, Mr. Cokeson.\n\nCOKESON.  [Preoccupied]  I'm glad to hear that.  About this matter.\nI don't like doing anything out of the ordinary; it's not my habit.\nI'm a plain man, and I want everything smooth and straight.  But I\npromised your friend to speak to the partners, and I always keep my\nword.\n\nFALDER.  I just want a chance, Mr. Cokeson.  I've paid for that job a\nthousand times and more.  I have, sir.  No one knows.  They say I\nweighed more when I came out than when I went in.  They couldn't\nweigh me here [he touches his head]  or here [he touches--his heart,\nand gives a sort of laugh].  Till last night I'd have thought there\nwas nothing in here at all.\n\nCOKESON.  [Concerned] You've not got heart disease?\n\nFALDER.  Oh!  they passed me sound enough.\n\nCOKESON.  But they got you a place, didn't they?\n\nFALSER.  Yes; very good people, knew all about it--very kind to me.\nI thought I was going to get on first rate.  But one day, all of a\nsudden, the other clerks got wind of it....  I couldn't stick it, Mr.\nCOKESON, I couldn't, sir.\n\nCOKESON. Easy, my dear fellow, easy!\n\nFALDER.  I had one small job after that, but it didn't last.\n\nCOKESON.  How was that?\n\nFALDER.  It's no good deceiving you, Mr. Cokeson.  The fact is, I\nseem to be struggling against a thing that's all round me.  I can't\nexplain it: it's as if I was in a net; as fast as I cut it here, it\ngrows up there.  I didn't act as I ought to have, about references;\nbut what are you to do?  You must have them.  And that made me\nafraid, and I left.  In fact, I'm--I'm afraid all the time now.\n\n     He bows his head and leans dejectedly silent over the table.\n\nCOKESON.  I feel for you--I do really.  Aren't your sisters going to\ndo anything for you?\n\nFALDER.  One's in consumption.  And the other----\n\nCOKESON.  Ye...es.  She told me her husband wasn't quite pleased with\nyou.\n\nFALDER.  When I went there--they were at supper--my sister wanted to\ngive me a kiss--I know.  But he just looked at her, and said: \"What\nhave you come for?\"  Well, I pocketed my pride and I said: \"Aren't\nyou going to give me your hand, Jim?  Cis is, I know,\" I said.  \"Look\nhere!\" he said, \"that's all very well, but we'd better come to an\nunderstanding.  I've been expecting you, and I've made up my mind.\nI'll give you fifteen pounds to go to Canada with.\"  \"I see,\" I\nsaid--\"good riddance!  No, thanks; keep your fifteen pounds.\"\nFriendship's a queer thing when you've been where I have.\n\nCOKESON.  I understand.  Will you take the fifteen pound from me?\n[Flustered, as FALDER regards him with a queer smile]  Quite without\nprejudice; I meant it kindly.\n\nFALDER.  I'm not allowed to leave the country.\n\nCOKESON.  Oh!  ye...es--ticket-of-leave?  You aren't looking the\nthing.\n\nFALDER.  I've slept in the Park three nights this week.  The dawns\naren't all poetry there.  But meeting her--I feel a different man\nthis morning.  I've often thought the being fond of hers the best\nthing about me; it's sacred, somehow--and yet it did for me.  That's\nqueer, isn't it?\n\nCOKESON.  I'm sure we're all very sorry for you.\n\nFALDER.  That's what I've found, Mr. Cokeson.  Awfully sorry for me.\n[With quiet bitterness]  But it doesn't do to associate with\ncriminals!\n\nCOKESON.  Come, come, it's no use calling yourself names.  That never\ndid a man any good.  Put a face on it.\n\nFALDER.  It's easy enough to put a face on it, sir, when you're\nindependent.  Try it when you're down like me.  They talk about\ngiving you your deserts.  Well, I think I've had just a bit over.\n\nCOKESON.  [Eyeing him askance over his spectacles]  I hope they haven't\nmade a Socialist of you.\n\n     FALDER is suddenly still, as if brooding over his past self; he\n     utters a peculiar laugh.\n\nCOKESON.  You must give them credit for the best intentions.  Really\nyou must.  Nobody wishes you harm, I'm sure.\n\nFALDER.  I believe that, Mr. Cokeson.  Nobody wishes you harm, but\nthey down you all the same.  This feeling--[He stares round him, as\nthough at something closing in]  It's crushing me.  [With sudden\nimpersonality]  I know it is.\n\nCOKESON.  [Horribly disturbed] There's nothing there!  We must try\nand take it quiet.  I'm sure I've often had you in my prayers.  Now\nleave it to me.  I'll use my gumption and take 'em when they're\njolly.  [As he speaks the two partners come in]\n\nCOKESON  [Rather disconcerted, but trying to put them all at ease]\nI didn't expect you quite so soon.  I've just been having a talk with\nthis young man.  I think you'll remember him.\n\nJAMES.  [With a grave, keen look] Quite well.  How are you, Falder?\n\nWALTER.  [Holding out his hand almost timidly] Very glad to see you\nagain, Falder.\n\nFALDER.  [Who has recovered his self-control, takes the hand] Thank\nyou, sir.\n\nCOKESON.  Just a word, Mr. James.  [To FALDER, pointing to the\nclerks' office] You might go in there a minute.  You know your way.\nOur junior won't be coming this morning.  His wife's just had a\nlittle family.\n\n     FALDER, goes uncertainly out into the clerks' office.\n\nCOKESON.  [Confidentially] I'm bound to tell you all about it.  He's\nquite penitent.  But there's a prejudice against him.  And you're not\nseeing him to advantage this morning; he's under-nourished.  It's\nvery trying to go without your dinner.\n\nJAMES.  Is that so, COKESON?\n\nCOKESON.  I wanted to ask you.  He's had his lesson.  Now we know all\nabout him, and we want a clerk.  There is a young fellow applying,\nbut I'm keeping him in the air.\n\nJAMES.  A gaol-bird in the office, COKESON?  I don't see it.\n\nWALTER.  \"The rolling of the chariot-wheels of Justice!\"  I've never\ngot that out of my head.\n\nJAMES.  I've nothing to reproach myself with in this affair.  What's\nhe been doing since he came out?\n\nCOKESON.  He's had one or two places, but he hasn't kept them.  He's\nsensitive--quite natural.  Seems to fancy everybody's down on him.\n\nJAMES.  Bad sign.  Don't like the fellow--never did from the first.\n\"Weak character\"'s written all over him.\n\nWALTER.  I think we owe him a leg up.\n\nJAMES.  He brought it all on himself.\n\nWALTER.  The doctrine of full responsibility doesn't quite hold in\nthese days.\n\nJAMES.  [Rather grimly]  You'll find it safer to hold it for all\nthat, my boy.\n\nWALTER.  For oneself, yes--not for other people, thanks.\n\nJAMES.  Well!  I don't want to be hard.\n\nCOKESON.  I'm glad to hear you say that.  He seems to see something\n[spreading his arms] round him.  'Tisn't healthy.\n\nJAMES.  What about that woman he was mixed up with?  I saw some one\nuncommonly like her outside as we came in.\n\nCOKESON.  That!  Well, I can't keep anything from you.  He has met\nher.\n\nJAMES.  Is she with her husband?\n\nCOKESON.  No.\n\nJAMES.  Falder living with her, I suppose?\n\nCOKESON.  [Desperately trying to retain the new-found jollity] I\ndon't know that of my own knowledge.  'Tisn't my business.\n\nJAMES.  It's our business, if we're going to engage him, COKESON.\n\nCOKESON.  [Reluctantly] I ought to tell you, perhaps.  I've had the\nparty here this morning.\n\nJAMES.  I thought so.  [To WALTER] No, my dear boy, it won't do.  Too\nshady altogether!\n\nCOKESON.  The two things together make it very awkward for you--I see\nthat.\n\nWALTER.  [Tentatively]  I don't quite know what we have to do with\nhis private life.\n\nJAMES.  No, no!  He must make a clean sheet of it, or he can't come\nhere.\n\nWALTER.  Poor devil!\n\nCOKESON.  Will you--have him in?  [And as JAMES nods] I think I can\nget him to see reason.\n\nJAMES.  [Grimly] You can leave that to me, COKESON.\n\nWALTER.  [To JAMES, in a low voice, while COKESON is summoning\nFALDER]  His whole future may depend on what we do, dad.\n\nFALDER comes in.  He has pulled himself together, and presents a\nsteady front.\n\nJAMES.  Now look here, Falder.  My son and I want to give you another\nchance; but there are two things I must say to you.  In the first\nplace: It's no good coming here as a victim.  If you've any notion\nthat you've been unjustly treated--get rid of it.  You can't play\nfast and loose with morality and hope to go scot-free.  If Society\ndidn't take care of itself, nobody would--the sooner you realise that\nthe better.\n\nFALDER.  Yes, sir; but--may I say something?\n\nJAMES.  Well?\n\nFALDER.  I had a lot of time to think it over in prison.  [He stops]\n\nCOKESON.  [Encouraging him] I'm sure you did.\n\nFALDER.  There were all sorts there.  And what I mean, sir, is, that\nif we'd been treated differently the first time, and put under\nsomebody that could look after us a bit, and not put in prison, not a\nquarter of us would ever have got there.\n\nJAMES.  [Shaking his head] I'm afraid I've very grave doubts of that,\nFalder.\n\nFALDER.  [With a gleam of malice] Yes, sir, so I found.\n\nJAMES.  My good fellow, don't forget that you began it.\n\nFALDER.  I never wanted to do wrong.\n\nJAMES.  Perhaps not.  But you did.\n\nFALDER.  [With all the bitterness of his past suffering] It's knocked\nme out of time.  [Pulling himself up]  That is, I mean, I'm not what\nI was.\n\nJAMES.  This isn't encouraging for us, Falder.\n\nCOKESON.  He's putting it awkwardly, Mr. James.\n\nFALDER.  [Throwing over his caution from the intensity of his\nfeeling]  I mean it, Mr. Cokeson.\n\nJAMES.  Now, lay aside all those thoughts, Falder, and look to the\nfuture.\n\nFALDER.  [Almost eagerly] Yes, sir, but you don't understand what\nprison is.  It's here it gets you.\n\n     He grips his chest.\n\nCOKESON.  [In a whisper to James] I told you he wanted nourishment.\n\nWALTER.  Yes, but, my dear fellow, that'll pass away.  Time's\nmerciful.\n\nFALDER.  [With his face twitching]  I hope so, sir.\n\nJAMES.  [Much more gently]  Now, my boy, what you've got to do is to\nput all the past behind you and build yourself up a steady\nreputation.  And that brings me to the second thing.  This woman you\nwere mixed up with you must give us your word, you know, to have done\nwith that.  There's no chance of your keeping straight if you're\ngoing to begin your future with such a relationship.\n\nFALDER.  [Looking from one to the other with a hunted expression] But\nsir...  but sir...  it's the one thing I looked forward to\nall that time.  And she too...  I couldn't find her before last\nnight.\n\n     During this and what follows COKESON becomes more and more\n     uneasy.\n\nJAMES.  This is painful, Falder.  But you must see for yourself that\nit's impossible for a firm like this to close its eyes to everything.\nGive us this proof of your resolve to keep straight, and you can come\nback--not otherwise.\n\nFALDER.  [After staring at JAMES, suddenly stiffens himself]  I\ncouldn't give her up.  I couldn't!  Oh, sir!\n\n     I'm all she's got to look to.  And I'm sure she's all I've got.\n\nJAMES.  I'm very sorry, Falder, but I must be firm.  It's for the\nbenefit of you both in the long run.  No good can come of this\nconnection.  It was the cause of all your disaster.\n\nFALDER.  But sir, it means-having gone through all that-getting\nbroken up--my nerves are in an awful state--for nothing.  I did it\nfor her.\n\nJAMES.  Come!  If she's anything of a woman she'll see it for\nherself.  She won't want to drag you down further.  If there were a\nprospect of your being able to marry her--it might be another thing.\n\nFALDER.  It's not my fault, sir, that she couldn't get rid of him\n--she would have if she could.  That's been the whole trouble from\nthe beginning.  [Looking suddenly at WALTER]...  If anybody\nwould help her!  It's only money wants now, I'm sure.\n\nCOKESON.  [Breaking in, as WALTER hesitates, and is about to speak] I\ndon't think we need consider that--it's rather far-fetched.\n\nFALDER.  [To WALTER, appealing]  He must have given her full cause\nsince; she could prove that he drove her to leave him.\n\nWALTER.  I'm inclined to do what you say, Falder, if it can be\nmanaged.\n\nFALDER.  Oh, sir!\n\nHe goes to the window and looks down into the street.\n\nCOKESON.  [Hurriedly]  You don't take me, Mr. Walter.  I have my\nreasons.\n\nFALDER.  [From the window]  She's down there, sir.  Will you see her?\nI can beckon to her from here.\n\n     WALTER hesitates, and looks from COKESON to JAMES.\n\nJAMES.  [With a sharp nod] Yes, let her come.\n\nFALDER beckons from the window.\n\nCOKESON.  [In a low fluster to JAMES and WALTER]  No, Mr. James.\nShe's not been quite what she ought to ha' been, while this young\nman's been away.  She's lost her chance.  We can't consult how to\nswindle the Law.\n\n     FALDER has come from the window.  The three men look at him in a\n     sort of awed silence.\n\nFALDER.  [With instinctive apprehension of some change--looking from\none to the other]  There's been nothing between us, sir, to prevent\nit....  What I said at the trial was true.  And last night we\nonly just sat in the Park.\n\nSWEEDLE comes in from the outer office.\n\nCOKESON.  What is it?\n\nSWEEDLE.  Mrs. Honeywill.   [There is silence]\n\nJAMES.  Show her in.\n\n     RUTH comes slowly in, and stands stoically with FALDER on one\n     side and the three men on the other.  No one speaks.  COKESON\n     turns to his table, bending over his papers as though the burden\n     of the situation were forcing him back into his accustomed\n     groove.\n\nJAMES.  [Sharply]  Shut the door there.  [SWEEDLE shuts the door]\nWe've asked you to come up because there are certain facts to be\nfaced in this matter.  I understand you have only just met Falder\nagain.\n\nRUTH.  Yes--only yesterday.\n\nJAMES.  He's told us about himself, and we're very sorry for him.\nI've promised to take him back here if he'll make a fresh start.\n[Looking steadily at RUTH] This is a matter that requires courage,\nma'am.\n\nRUTH, who is looking at FALDER, begins to twist her hands in front of\nher as though prescient of disaster.\n\nFALDER.  Mr. Walter How is good enough to say that he'll help us to\nget you a divorce.\n\n     RUTH flashes a startled glance at JAMES and WALTER.\n\nJAMES.  I don't think that's practicable, Falder.\n\nFALDER.  But, Sir----!\n\nJAMES.  [Steadily]  Now, Mrs. Honeywill.  You're fond of him.\n\nRUTH.  Yes, Sir; I love him.\n\n     She looks miserably at FALDER.\n\nJAMES.  Then you don't want to stand in his way, do you?\n\nRUTH.  [In a faint voice] I could take care of him.\n\nJAMES.  The best way you can take care of him will be to give him up.\n\nFALDER.  Nothing shall make me give you up.  You can get a divorce.\nThere's been nothing between us, has there?\n\nRUTH.  [Mournfully shaking her head-without looking at him]  No.\n\nFALDER.  We'll keep apart till it's over, sir; if you'll only help\nus--we promise.\n\nJAMES.  [To RUTH]  You see the thing plainly, don't you?  You see\nwhat I mean?\n\nRUTH.  [Just above a whisper]  Yes.\n\nCOKESON.  [To himself] There's a dear woman.\n\nJAMES.  The situation is impossible.\n\nRUTH.  Must I, Sir?\n\nJAMES.  [Forcing himself to look at her] I put it to you, ma'am.  His\nfuture is in your hands.\n\nRUTH.  [Miserably] I want to do the best for him.\n\nJAMES.  [A little huskily] That's right, that's right!\n\nFALDER.  I don't understand.  You're not going to give me up--after\nall this?  There's something--[Starting forward to JAMES] Sir, I\nswear solemnly there's been nothing between us.\n\nJAMES.  I believe you, Falder.  Come, my lad, be as plucky as she is.\n\nFALDER.  Just now you were going to help us.  [He starts at RUTH, who\nis standing absolutely still; his face and hands twitch and quiver as\nthe truth dawns on him]  What is it?  You've not been--\n\nWALTER.  Father!\n\nJAMES.  [Hurriedly]  There, there!  That'll do, that'll do!  I'll\ngive you your chance, Falder.  Don't let me know what you do with\nyourselves, that's all.\n\nFALDER.  [As if he has not heard] Ruth?\n\n     RUTH looks at him; and FALDER covers his face with his hands.\n     There is silence.\n\nCOKESON.  [Suddenly]  There's some one out there.  [To RUTH]  Go in\nhere.  You'll feel better by yourself for a minute.\n\n     He points to the clerks' room and moves towards the outer\n     office.  FALDER does not move.  RUTH puts out her hand timidly.\n     He shrinks back from the touch.  She turns and goes miserably\n     into the clerks' room.  With a brusque movement he follows,\n     seizing her by the shoulder just inside the doorway.  COKESON\n     shuts the door.\n\nJAMES.  [Pointing to the outer office]  Get rid of that, whoever it\nis.\n\nSWEEDLE.  [Opening the office door, in a scared voice]\nDetective-Sergeant blister.\n\n     The detective enters, and closes the door behind him.\n\nWISTER.  Sorry to disturb you, sir.  A clerk you had here, two years\nand a half ago: I arrested him in, this room.\n\nJAMES.  What about him?\n\nWISTER.  I thought perhaps I might get his whereabouts from you.\n[There is an awkward silence]\n\nCOKESON.  [Pleasantly, coming to the rescue] We're not responsible\nfor his movements; you know that.\n\nJAMES.  What do you want with him?\n\nWISTER.  He's failed to report himself this last four weeks.\n\nWALTER.  How d'you mean?\n\nWISTER.  Ticket-of-leave won't be up for another six months, sir.\n\nWALTER.  Has he to keep in touch with the police till then?\n\nWISTER.  We're bound to know where he sleeps every night.  I dare say\nwe shouldn't interfere, sir, even though he hasn't reported himself.\nBut we've just heard there's a serious matter of obtaining employment\nwith a forged reference.  What with the two things together--we must\nhave him.\n\n     Again there is silence.  WALTER and COKESON steal glances at\n     JAMES, who stands staring steadily at the detective.\n\nCOKESON.  [Expansively]  We're very busy at the moment.  If you could\nmake it convenient to call again we might be able to tell you then.\n\nJAMES.  [Decisively] I'm a servant of the Law, but I dislike\npeaching.  In fact, I can't do such a thing.  If you want him you\nmust find him without us.\n\n     As he speaks his eye falls on FALDER'S cap, still lying on the\n     table, and his face contracts.\n\nWISTER.  [Noting the gesture--quietly]  Very good, sir.  I ought to\nwarn you that, having broken the terms of his licence, he's still a\nconvict, and sheltering a convict.\n\nJAMES.  I shelter no one.  But you mustn't come here and ask\nquestions which it's not my business to answer.\n\nWISTER.  [Dryly] I won't trouble you further then, gentlemen.\n\nCOKESON.  I'm sorry we couldn't give you the information.  You quite\nunderstand, don't you?  Good-morning!\n\n     WISTER turns to go, but instead of going to the door of the\n     outer office he goes to the door of the clerks' room.\n\nCOKESON.  The other door....  the other door!\n\n     WISTER opens the clerks' door.  RUTHS's voice is heard: \"Oh,\n     do!\" and FALDER'S: \"I can't!\"  There is a little pause; then,\n     with sharp fright, RUTH says: \"Who's that?\"\n\n     WISTER has gone in.\n\n     The three men look aghast at the door.\n\nWISTER  [From within]  Keep back, please!\n\n     He comes swiftly out with his arm twisted in FALDER'S.  The\n     latter gives a white, staring look at the three men.\n\nWALTER.  Let him go this time, for God's sake!\n\nWISTER.  I couldn't take the responsibility, sir.\n\nFALDER.  [With a queer, desperate laugh]  Good!\n\n     Flinging a look back at RUTH, he throws up his head, and goes\n     out through the outer office, half dragging WISTER after him.\n\nWALTER.  [With despair]  That finishes him.  It'll go on for ever\nnow.\n\n     SWEEDLE can be seen staring through the outer door.  There are\n     sounds of footsteps descending the stone stairs; suddenly a dull\n     thud, a faint \"My God!\" in WISTER's voice.\n\nJAMES.  What's that?\n\n     SWEEDLE dashes forward.  The door swings to behind him.  There\n     is dead silence.\n\nWALTER.  [Starting forward to the inner room] The woman-she's\nfainting!\n\n     He and COKESON support the fainting RUTH from the doorway of the\n     clerks' room.\n\nCOKESON.  [Distracted]  Here, my dear!  There, there!\n\nWALTER.  Have you any brandy?\n\nCOKESON.  I've got sherry.\n\nWALTER.  Get it, then.  Quick!\n\n     He places RUTH in a chair--which JAMES has dragged forward.\n\nCOKESON.  [With sherry] Here!  It's good strong sherry.  [They try to\nforce the sherry between her lips.]\n\n     There is the sound of feet, and they stop to listen.\n\n     The outer door is reopened--WISTER and SWEEDLE are seen carrying\n     some burden.\n\nJAMES.  [Hurrying forward]  What is it?\n\n     They lay the burden doom in the outer office, out of sight, and\n     all but RUTH cluster round it, speaking in hushed voices.\n\nWISTER.  He jumped--neck's broken.\n\nWALTER.  Good God!\n\nWISTER.  He must have been mad to think he could give me the slip\nlike that.  And what was it--just a few months!\n\nWALTER.  [Bitterly] Was that all?\n\nJAMES.  What a desperate thing!  [Then, in a voice unlike his own]\nRun for a doctor--you!  [SWEEDLE rushes from the outer office] An\nambulance!\n\n     WISTER goes out.  On RUTH's face an expression of fear and\n     horror has been seen growing, as if she dared not turn towards\n     the voices.  She now rises and steals towards them.\n\nWALTER.  [Turning suddenly] Look!\n\n     The three men shrink back out of her way, one by one, into\n     COKESON'S room.  RUTH drops on her knees by the body.\n\nRUTH.  [In a whisper]  What is it?  He's not breathing.  [She\ncrouches over him]  My dear!  My pretty!\n\n     In the outer office doorway the figures of men am seen standing.\n\nRUTH.  [Leaping to her feet] No, no!  No, no!  He's dead!\n\n     [The figures of the men shrink back]\n\nCOKESON.  [Stealing forward.  In a hoarse voice] There, there, poor\ndear woman!\n\n     At the sound behind her RUTH faces round at him.\n\nCOKESON.  No one'll touch him now!  Never again!  He's safe with\ngentle Jesus!\n\n     RUTH stands as though turned to stone in the doorway staring at\n     COKESON, who, bending humbly before her, holds out his hand as\n     one would to a lost dog.\n\n\n\nThe curtain falls.\n\n\n\n\n\n End of Project Gutenberg's Justice (Second Series Plays), by John Galsworthy\n\n ",
