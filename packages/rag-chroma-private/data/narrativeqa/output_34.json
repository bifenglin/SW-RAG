And people.\n\nThe people paid no attention to their insignificance. They built ships\nwhich went through emptiness beyond imagining, and they landed upon\nplanets and rebuilt them to their own liking. Suns flamed terribly,\nrenting their impertinence, and storms swept across the planets\nthey preÃ«mpted, but the people built more strongly and were secure.\nEverything in the universe was bigger or stronger than the people,\nbut they ignored the fact. They went about the businesses they had\ncontrived for themselves.\n\nThey were not afraid of anything until somewhere on a certain small\nplanet an infinitesimal single molecule changed itself.\n\nIt was one molecule among unthinkably many, upon one planet of one\nsolar system among uncountable star clusters. It was not exactly alive,\nbut it acted as if it were, in which it was like all the important\nmatter of the cosmos. It was actually a combination of two complicated\nsubstances not too firmly joined together. When one of the parts\nchanged, it became a new molecule. But, like the original one, it was\nstill capable of a process called autocatalysis. It practiced that\nprocess and catalyzed other molecules into existence, which in each\ncase were duplicates of itself. Then mankind had to take notice, though\nit ignored flaming suns and monstrous storms and emptiness past belief.\n\nMen called the new molecule a virus and gave it a name. They called it\nand its duplicates \"chlorophage.\" And chlorophage was, to people, the\nmost terrifying thing in the universe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a strictly temporary orbit around the planet Altaira, the _Star\nQueen_ floated, while lift-ships brought passengers and cargo up to\nit. The ship was too large to be landed economically at an unimportant\nspaceport like Altaira. It was a very modern ship and it made the\nRegulus-to-Cassim run, which is five hundred light-years, in only fifty\ndays of Earthtime.\n\nNow the lift-ships were busy. There was an unusual number of passengers\nto board the _Star Queen_ at Altaira and an unusual number of them were\nwomen and children. The children tended to pudginess and the women had\nthe dieted look of the wives of well-to-do men. Most of them looked\nred-eyed, as if they had been crying.\n\nOne by one the lift-ships hooked onto the airlock of the _Star Queen_\nand delivered passengers and cargo to the ship. Presently the last of\nthem was hooked on, and the last batch of passengers came through to\nthe liner, and the ship's doctor watched them stream past him.\n\nHis air was negligent, but he was actually impatient. Like most\ndoctors, Nordenfeld approved of lean children and wiry women. They had\nfewer things wrong with them and they responded better to treatment.\nWell, he was the doctor of the _Star Queen_ and he had much authority.\nHe'd exerted it back on Regulus to insist that a shipment of botanical\nspecimens for Cassim travel in quarantine--to be exact, in the ship's\npractically unused hospital compartment--and he was prepared to\nexercise authority over the passengers.\n\nHe had a sheaf of health slips from the examiners on the ground below.\nThere was one slip for each passenger. It certified that so-and-so had\nbeen examined and could safely be admitted to the _Star Queen's_ air,\nher four restaurants, her two swimming pools, her recreation areas and\nthe six levels of passenger cabins the ship contained.\n\nHe impatiently watched the people go by. Health slips or no health\nslips, he looked them over. A characteristic gait or a typical\ncomplexion tint, or even a certain lack of hair luster, could tell him\nthings that ground physicians might miss. In such a case the passenger\nwould go back down again. It was not desirable to have deaths on a\nliner in space. Of course nobody was ever refused passage because of\nchlorophage. If it were ever discovered, the discovery would already be\ntoo late. But the health regulations for space travel were very, very\nstrict.\n\nHe looked twice at a young woman as she passed. Despite applied\ncomplexion, there was a trace of waxiness in her skin. Nordenfeld had\nnever actually seen a case of chlorophage. No doctor alive ever had.\nThe best authorities were those who'd been in Patrol ships during the\nquarantine of Kamerun when chlorophage was loose on that planet. They'd\nseen beamed-up pictures of patients, but not patients themselves. The\nPatrol ships stayed in orbit while the planet died. Most doctors, and\nNordenfeld was among them, had only seen pictures of the screens which\nshowed the patients.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked sharply at the young woman. Then he glanced at her hands.\nThey were normal. The young woman went on, unaware that for the\nfraction of an instant there had been the possibility of the landing of\nthe _Star Queen_ on Altaira, and the destruction of her space drive,\nand the establishment of a quarantine which, if justified, would mean\nthat nobody could ever leave Altaira again, but must wait there to die.\nWhich would not be a long wait.\n\nA fat man puffed past. The gravity on Altaira was some five per cent\nunder ship-normal and he felt the difference at once. But the veins at\nhis temples were ungorged. Nordenfeld let him go by.\n\nThere appeared a white-haired, space-tanned man with a briefcase under\nhis arm. He saw Nordenfeld and lifted a hand in greeting. The doctor\nknew him. He stepped aside from the passengers and stood there. His\nname was Jensen, and he represented a fund which invested the surplus\nmoney of insurance companies. He traveled a great deal to check on the\nbusiness interests of that organization.\n\nThe doctor grunted, \"What're you doing here? I thought you'd be on the\nfar side of the cluster.\"\n\n\"Oh, I get about,\" said Jensen. His manner was not quite normal. He was\ntense. \"I got here two weeks ago on a Q-and-C tramp from Regulus. We\nwere a ship load of salt meat. There's romance for you! Salt meat by\nthe spaceship load!\"\n\nThe doctor grunted again. All sorts of things moved through space,\nnaturally. The _Star Queen_ carried a botanical collection for a museum\nand pig-beryllium and furs and enzymes and a list of items no man could\nremember. He watched the passengers go by, automatically counting them\nagainst the number of health slips in his hand.\n\n\"Lots of passengers this trip,\" said Jensen.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor, watching a man with a limp. \"Why?\"\n\nJensen shrugged and did not answer. He was uneasy, the doctor noted.\nHe and Jensen were as much unlike as two men could very well be, but\nJensen was good company. A ship's doctor does not have much congenial\nsociety.\n\nThe file of passengers ended abruptly. There was no one in the _Star\nQueen's_ airlock, but the \"Connected\" lights still burned and the\ndoctor could look through into the small lift-ship from the planet down\nbelow. He frowned. He fingered the sheaf of papers.\n\n\"Unless I missed count,\" he said annoyedly, \"there's supposed to be one\nmore passenger. I don't see--\"\n\nA door opened far back in the lift-ship. A small figure appeared. It\nwas a little girl perhaps ten years old. She was very neatly dressed,\nthough not quite the way a mother would have done it. She wore the\ncarefully composed expression of a child with no adult in charge of\nher. She walked precisely from the lift-ship into the _Star Queen's_\nlock. The opening closed briskly behind her. There was the rumbling of\nseals making themselves tight. The lights flickered for \"Disconnect\"\nand then \"All Clear.\" They went out, and the lift-ship had pulled away\nfrom the _Star Queen_.\n\n\"There's my missing passenger,\" said the doctor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe child looked soberly about. She saw him. \"Excuse me,\" she said very\npolitely. \"Is this the way I'm supposed to go?\"\n\n\"Through that door,\" said the doctor gruffly.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the little girl. She followed his direction. She\nvanished through the door. It closed.\n\nThere came a deep, droning sound, which was the interplanetary drive\nof the _Star Queen_, building up that directional stress in space\nwhich had seemed such a triumph when it was first contrived. The ship\nswung gently. It would be turning out from orbit around Altaira. It\nswung again. The doctor knew that its astrogators were feeling for the\nincredibly exact pointing of its nose toward the next port which modern\ncommercial ship operation required. An error of fractional seconds of\narc would mean valuable time lost in making port some ten light-years\nof distance away. The drive droned and droned, building up velocity\nwhile the ship's aiming was refined and re-refined.\n\nThe drive cut off abruptly. Jensen turned white.\n\nThe doctor said impatiently, \"There's nothing wrong. Probably a message\nor a report should have been beamed down to the planet and somebody\nforgot. We'll go on in a minute.\"\n\nBut Jensen stood frozen. He was very pale. The interplanetary drive\nstayed off. Thirty seconds. A minute. Jensen swallowed audibly. Two\nminutes. Three.\n\nThe steady, monotonous drone began again. It continued interminably, as\nif while it was off the ship's head had swung wide of its destination\nand the whole business of lining up for a jump in overdrive had to be\ndone all over again.\n\nThen there came that \"Ping-g-g-g!\" and the sensation of spiral fall\nwhich meant overdrive. The droning ceased.\n\nJensen breathed again. The ship's doctor looked at him sharply. Jensen\nhad been taut. Now the tensions had left his body, but he looked as\nif he were going to shiver. Instead, he mopped a suddenly streaming\nforehead.\n\n\"I think,\" said Jensen in a strange voice, \"that I'll have a drink. Or\nseveral. Will you join me?\"\n\nNordenfeld searched his face. A ship's doctor has many duties in\nspace. Passengers can have many things wrong with them, and in the\nabsolute isolation of overdrive they can be remarkably affected by each\nother.\n\n\"I'll be at the fourth-level bar in twenty minutes,\" said Nordenfeld.\n\"Can you wait that long?\"\n\n\"I probably won't wait to have a drink,\" said Jensen. \"But I'll be\nthere.\"\n\nThe doctor nodded curtly. He went away. He made no guesses, though he'd\njust observed the new passengers carefully and was fully aware of the\nstrict health regulations that affect space travel. As a physician he\nknew that the most deadly thing in the universe was chlorophage and\nthat the planet Kamerun was only one solar system away. It had been\na stop for the _Star Queen_ until four years ago. He puzzled over\nJensen's tenseness and the relief he'd displayed when the overdrive\nfield came on. But he didn't guess. Chlorophage didn't enter his mind.\n\nNot until later.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw the little girl who'd come out of the airlock last of all the\npassengers. She sat on a sofa as if someone had told her to wait there\nuntil something or other was arranged. Doctor Nordenfeld barely glanced\nat her. He'd known Jensen for a considerable time. Jensen had been\na passenger on the _Star Queen_ half a dozen times, and he shouldn't\nhave been upset by the temporary stoppage of an interplanetary drive.\nNordenfeld divided people into two classes, those who were not and\nthose who were worth talking to. There weren't many of the latter.\nJensen was.\n\nHe filed away the health slips. Then, thinking of Jensen's pallor,\nhe asked what had happened to make the _Star Queen_ interrupt her\nslow-speed drive away from orbit around Altaira.\n\nThe purser told him. But the purser was fussily concerned because there\nwere so many extra passengers from Altaira. He might not be able to\ntake on the expected number of passengers at the next stop-over point.\nIt would be bad business to have to refuse passengers! It would give\nthe space line a bad name.\n\nThen the air officer stopped Nordenfeld as he was about to join Jensen\nin the fourth-level bar. It was time for a medical inspection of the\nquarter-acre of Banthyan jungle which purified and renewed the air\nof the ship. Nordenfeld was expected to check the complex ecological\nsystem of the air room. Specifically, he was expected to look for and\nidentify any patches of colorlessness appearing on the foliage of the\njungle plants the _Star Queen_ carried through space.\n\nThe air officer was discreet and Nordenfeld was silent about the\nultimate reason for the inspection. Nobody liked to think about it. But\nif a particular kind of bleaching appeared, as if the chlorophyll of\nthe leaves were being devoured by something too small to be seen by an\noptical microscope--why, that would be chlorophage. It would also be a\ndeath sentence for the _Star Queen_ and everybody in her.\n\nBut the jungle passed medical inspection. The plants grew lushly in\nsoil which periodically was flushed with hydroponic solution and\nthen drained away again. The UV lamps were properly distributed and\nthe different quarters of the air room were alternately lighted and\ndarkened. And there were no colorless patches. A steady wind blew\nthrough the air room and had its excess moisture and unpleasing smells\nwrung out before it recirculated through the ship. Doctor Nordenfeld\nauthorized the trimming of some liana-like growths which were\ndeveloping woody tissue at the expense of leaves.\n\nThe air officer also told him about the reason for the turning off of\nthe interplanetary drive. He considered it a very curious happening.\n\nThe doctor left the air room and passed the place where the little\ngirl--the last passenger to board the _Star Queen_--waited patiently\nfor somebody to arrange something. Doctor Nordenfeld took a lift to the\nfourth level and went into the bar where Jensen should be waiting.\n\nHe was. He had an empty glass before him. Nordenfeld sat down and\ndialed for a drink. He had an indefinite feeling that something was\nwrong, but he couldn't put his finger on it. There are always things\ngoing wrong for a ship's doctor, though. There are so many demands on\nhis patience that he is usually short of it.\n\nJensen watched him sip at his drink.\n\n\"A bad day?\" he asked. He'd gotten over his own tension.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNordenfeld shrugged, but his scowl deepened. \"There are a lot of new\npassengers.\" He realized that he was trying to explain his feelings to\nhimself. \"They'll come to me feeling miserable. I have to tell each one\nthat if they feel heavy and depressed, it may be the gravity-constant\nof the ship, which is greater than their home planet. If they feel\nlight-headed and giddy, it may be because the gravity-constant of\nthe ship is less than they're used to. But it doesn't make them feel\nbetter, so they come back for a second assurance. I'll be overwhelmed\nwith such complaints within two hours.\"\n\nJensen waited. Then he said casually--too casually, \"Does anybody ever\nsuspect chlorophage?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Nordenfeld shortly.\n\nJensen fidgeted. He sipped. Then he said, \"What's the news from\nKamerun, anyhow?\"\n\n\"There isn't any,\" said Nordenfeld. \"Naturally! Why ask?\"\n\n\"I just wondered,\" said Jensen. After a moment: \"What was the last\nnews?\"\n\n\"There hasn't been a message from Kamerun in two years,\" said\nNordenfeld curtly. \"There's no sign of anything green anywhere on the\nplanet. It's considered to be--uninhabited.\"\n\nJensen licked his lips. \"That's what I understood. Yes.\"\n\nNordenfeld drank half his drink and said unpleasantly, \"There were\nthirty million people on Kamerun when the chlorophage appeared. At\nfirst it was apparently a virus which fed on the chlorophyll of\nplants. They died. Then it was discovered that it could also feed on\nhemoglobin, which is chemically close to chlorophyll. Hemoglobin is the\nred coloring matter of the blood. When the virus consumed it, people\nbegan to die. Kamerun doctors found that the chlorophage virus was\ntransmitted by contact, by inhalation, by ingestion. It traveled as\ndust particles and on the feet of insects, and it was in drinking water\nand the air one breathed. The doctors on Kamerun warned spaceships\noff and the Patrol put a quarantine fleet in orbit around it to keep\nanybody from leaving. And nobody left. And everybody died. _And_ so did\nevery living thing that had chlorophyll in its leaves or hemoglobin in\nits blood, or that needed plant or animal tissues to feed on. There's\nnot a person left alive on Kamerun, nor an animal or bird or insect,\nnor a fish nor a tree, or plant or weed or blade of grass. There's no\nlonger a quarantine fleet there. Nobody'll go there and there's nobody\nleft to leave. But there are beacon satellites to record any calls and\nto warn any fool against landing. If the chlorophage got loose and was\ncarried about by spaceships, it could kill the other forty billion\nhumans in the galaxy, together with every green plant or animal with\nhemoglobin in its blood.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Jensen, and tried to smile, \"sounds final.\"\n\n\"It isn't,\" Nordenfeld told him. \"If there's something in the\nuniverse which can kill every living thing except its maker, that\nsomething should be killed. There should be research going on about\nthe chlorophage. It would be deadly dangerous work, but it should be\ndone. A quarantine won't stop contagion. It can only hinder it. That's\nuseful, but not enough.\"\n\nJensen moistened his lips.\n\nNordenfeld said abruptly, \"I've answered your questions. Now what's on\nyour mind and what has it to do with chlorophage?\"\n\nJensen started. He went very pale.\n\n\"It's too late to do anything about it,\" said Nordenfeld. \"It's\nprobably nonsense anyhow. But what is it?\"\n\nJensen stammered out his story. It explained why there were so many\npassengers for the _Star Queen_. It even explained his departure from\nAltaira. But it was only a rumor--the kind of rumor that starts up\nuntraceably and can never be verified. This one was officially denied\nby the Altairan planetary government. But it was widely believed by the\nsort of people who usually were well-informed. Those who could sent\ntheir families up to the _Star Queen_. And that was why Jensen had been\ntense and worried until the liner had actually left Altaira behind.\nThen he felt safe.\n\nNordenfeld's jaw set as Jensen told his tale. He made no comment, but\nwhen Jensen was through he nodded and went away, leaving his drink\nunfinished. Jensen couldn't see his face; it was hard as granite.\n\nAnd Nordenfeld, the ship's doctor of the _Star Queen_, went into the\nnearest bathroom and was violently sick. It was a reaction to what he'd\njust learned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were stars which were so far away that their distance didn't\nmean anything. There were planets beyond counting in a single star\ncluster, let alone the galaxy. There were comets and gas clouds in\nspace, and worlds where there was life, and other worlds where life was\nimpossible. The quantity of matter which was associated with life was\ninfinitesimal, and the quantity associated with consciousness--animal\nlife--was so much less that the difference couldn't be expressed.\nBut the amount of animal life which could reason was so minute by\ncomparison that the nearest ratio would be that of a single atom to\na sun. Mankind, in fact, was the least impressive fraction of the\nsmallest category of substance in the galaxy.\n\nBut men did curious things.\n\nThere was the cutting off of the _Star Queen's_ short-distance drive\nbefore she'd gotten well away from Altaira. There had been a lift-ship\nlocked to the liner's passenger airlock. When the last passenger\nentered the big ship--a little girl--the airlocks disconnected and the\nlift-ship pulled swiftly away.\n\nIt was not quite two miles from the _Star Queen_ when its emergency\nairlocks opened and spacesuited figures plunged out of it to emptiness.\nSimultaneously, the ports of the lift-ship glowed and almost\nimmediately the whole plating turned cherry-red, crimson, and then\norange, from unlimited heat developed within it.\n\nThe lift-ship went incandescent and ruptured and there was a spout\nof white-hot air, and then it turned blue-white and puffed itself to\nnothing in metallic steam. Where it had been there was only shining\ngas, which cooled. Beyond it there were figures in spacesuits which\ntried to swim away from it.\n\nThe _Star Queen's_ control room, obviously, saw the happening. The\nlift-ship's atomic pile had flared out of control and melted down the\nship. It had developed something like sixty thousand degrees Fahrenheit\nwhen it ceased to flare. It did not blow up; it only vaporized. But\nthe process must have begun within seconds after the lift-ship broke\ncontact with the _Star Queen_.\n\nIn automatic reaction, the man in control of the liner cut her drive\nand offered to turn back and pick up the spacesuited figures in\nemptiness. The offer was declined with almost hysterical haste. In\nfact, it was barely made before the other lift-ships moved in on rescue\nmissions. They had waited. And they were picking up castaways before\nthe _Star Queen_ resumed its merely interplanetary drive and the\nprocess of aiming for a solar system some thirty light-years away.\n\nWhen the liner flicked into overdrive, more than half the floating\nfigures had been recovered, which was remarkable. It was almost as\nremarkable as the flare-up of the lift-ship's atomic pile. One has\nto know exactly what to do to make a properly designed atomic pile\nvaporize metal. Somebody had known. Somebody had done it. And the other\nlift-ships were waiting to pick up the destroyed lift-ship's crew when\nit happened.\n\nThe matter of the lift-ship's destruction was fresh in Nordenfeld's\nmind when Jensen had told his story. The two items fitted together with\nan appalling completeness. They left little doubt or hope.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNordenfeld consulted the passenger records and presently was engaged in\nconversation with the sober-faced, composed little girl on a sofa in\none of the cabin levels of the _Star Queen_.\n\n\"You're Kathy Brand, I believe,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"I\nunderstand you've been having a rather bad time of it.\"\n\nShe seemed to consider.\n\n\"It hasn't been too bad,\" she assured him. \"At least I've been seeing\nnew things. I got dreadfully tired of seeing the same things all the\ntime.\"\n\n\"What things?\" asked Nordenfeld. His expression was not stern now,\nthough his inner sensations were not pleasant. He needed to talk to\nthis child, and he had learned how to talk to children. The secret is\nto talk exactly as to an adult, with respect and interest.\n\n\"There weren't any windows,\" she explained, \"and my father couldn't\nplay with me, and all the toys and books were ruined by the water. It\nwas dreadfully tedious. There weren't any other children, you see. And\npresently there weren't any grownups but my father.\"\n\nNordenfeld only looked more interested. He'd been almost sure ever\nsince knowing of the lift-ship's destruction and listening to Jensen's\naccount of the rumor the government of Altaira denied. He was horribly\nsure now.\n\n\"How long were you in the place that hadn't any windows?\"\n\n\"Oh, dreadfully long!\" she said. \"Since I was only six years old!\nAlmost half my life!\" She smiled brightly at him. \"I remember looking\nout of windows and even playing out-of-doors, but my father and mother\nsaid I had to live in this place. My father talked to me often and\noften. He was very nice. But he had to wear that funny suit and keep\nthe glass over his face because he didn't live in the room. The glass\nwas because he went under the water, you know.\"\n\nNordenfeld asked carefully conversational-sounding questions. Kathy\nBrand, now aged ten, had been taken by her father to live in a big room\nwithout any windows. It hadn't any doors, either. There were plants in\nit, and there were bluish lights to shine on the plants, and there was\na place in one corner where there was water. When her father came in to\ntalk to her, he came up out of the water wearing the funny suit with\nglass over his face. He went out the same way. There was a place in\nthe wall where she could look out into another room, and at first her\nmother used to come and smile at her through the glass, and she talked\ninto something she held in her hand, and her voice came inside. But\nlater she stopped coming.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was only one possible kind of place which would answer Kathy's\ndescription. When she was six years old she had been put into some\nuniversity's aseptic-environment room. And she had stayed there. Such\nrooms were designed for biological research. They were built and then\nmade sterile of all bacterial life and afterward entered through a tank\nof antiseptic. Anyone who entered wore a suit which was made germ-free\nby its passage through the antiseptic, and he did not breathe the air\nof the aseptic room, but air which was supplied him through a hose, the\nexhaled-air hose also passing under the antiseptic outside. No germ\nor microbe or virus could possibly get into such a room without being\nbathed in corrosive fluid which would kill it. So long as there was\nsomeone alive outside to take care of her, a little girl could live\nthere and defy even chlorophage.\n\nAnd Kathy Brand had done it. But, on the other hand, Kamerun was the\nonly planet where it would be necessary, and it was the only world\nfrom which a father would land his small daughter on another planet's\nspaceport. There was no doubt. Nordenfeld grimly imagined someone--he\nwould have had to be a microbiologist even to attempt it--fighting to\nsurvive and defeat the chlorophage while he kept his little girl in an\naseptic-environment room.\n\nShe explained quite pleasantly as Nordenfeld asked more questions.\nThere had been other people besides her father, but for a long time\nthere had been only him. And Nordenfeld computed that somehow she'd\nbeen kept alive on the dead planet Kamerun for four long years.\n\nRecently, though--very recently--her father told her that they were\nleaving. Wearing his funny, antiseptic-wetted suit, he'd enclosed her\nin a plastic bag with a tank attached to it. Air flowed from the tank\ninto the bag and out through a hose that was all wetted inside. She\nbreathed quite comfortably.\n\nIt made sense. An air tank could be heated and its contents sterilized\nto supply germ-free--or virus-free--air. And Kathy's father took an axe\nand chopped away a wall of the room. He picked her up, still inside the\nplastic bag, and carried her out. There was nobody about. There was no\ngrass. There were no trees. Nothing moved.\n\nHere Kathy's account was vague, but Nordenfeld could guess at the\nstrangeness of a dead planet, to the child who barely remembered\nanything but the walls of an aseptic-environment room.\n\nHer father carried her to a little ship, said Kathy, and they talked\na lot after the ship took off. He told her that he was taking her to\na place where she could run about outdoors and play, but he had to go\nsomewhere else. He did mysterious things which to Nordenfeld meant a\nmost scrupulous decontamination of a small spaceship's interior and\nits airlock. Its outer surface would reach a temperature at which no\norganic material could remain uncooked.\n\nAnd finally, said Kathy, her father had opened a door and told her to\nstep out and good-by, and she did, and the ship went away--her father\nstill wearing his funny suit--and people came and asked her questions\nshe did not understand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKathy's narrative fitted perfectly into the rumor Jensen said\ncirculated among usually well-informed people on Altaira. They\nbelieved, said Jensen, that a small spaceship had appeared in the sky\nabove Altaira's spaceport. It ignored all calls, landed swiftly, opened\nan airlock and let someone out, and plunged for the sky again. And the\nstory said that radar telescopes immediately searched for and found\nthe ship in space. They trailed it, calling vainly for it to identify\nitself, while it drove at top speed for Altaira's sun.\n\nIt reached the sun and dived in.\n\nNordenfeld reached the skipper on intercom vision-phone. Jensen had\nbeen called there to repeat his tale to the skipper.\n\n\"I've talked to the child,\" said Nordenfeld grimly, \"and I'm putting\nher into isolation quarters in the hospital compartment. She's from\nKamerun. She was kept in an aseptic-environment room at some university\nor other. She says her father looked after her. I get an impression of\na last-ditch fight by microbiologists against the chlorophage. They\nlost it. Apparently her father landed her on Altaira and dived into\nthe sun. From her story, he took every possible precaution to keep her\nfrom contagion or carrying contagion with her to Altaira. Maybe he\nsucceeded. There's no way to tell--yet.\"\n\nThe skipper listened in silence.\n\nJensen said thinly, \"Then the story about the landing was true.\"\n\n\"Yes. The authorities isolated her, and then shipped her off on the\n_Star Queen_. Your well-informed friends, Jensen, didn't know what\ntheir government was going to do!\" Nordenfeld paused, and said more\ncoldly still, \"They didn't handle it right. They should have killed\nher, painlessly but at once. Her body should have been immersed, with\neverything that had touched it, in full-strength nitric acid. The\nsame acid should have saturated the place where the ship landed and\nevery place she walked. Every room she entered, and every hall she\npassed through, should have been doused with nitric and then burned.\nIt would still not have been all one could wish. The air she breathed\ncouldn't be recaptured and heated white-hot. But the chances for\nAltaira's population to go on living would be improved. Instead, they\nisolated her and they shipped her off with us--and thought they were\naccomplishing something by destroying the lift-ship that had her in an\nairtight compartment until she walked into the _Star Queen's_ lock!\"\n\nThe skipper said heavily, \"Do you think she's brought chlorophage on\nboard?\"\n\n\"I've no idea,\" said Nordenfeld. \"If she did, it's too late to do\nanything but drive the _Star Queen_ into the nearest sun.... No. Before\nthat, one should give warning that she was aground on Altaira. No ship\nshould land there. No ship should take off. Altaira should be blocked\noff from the rest of the galaxy like Kamerun was. And to the same end\nresult.\"\n\nJensen said unsteadily; \"There'll be trouble if this is known on the\nship. There'll be some unwilling to sacrifice themselves.\"\n\n\"Sacrifice?\" said Nordenfeld. \"They're dead! But before they lie down,\nthey can keep everybody they care about from dying too! Would you want\nto land and have your wife and family die of it?\"\n\nThe skipper said in the same heavy voice, \"What are the probabilities?\nYou say there was an effort to keep her from contagion. What are the\nodds?\"\n\n\"Bad,\" said Nordenfeld. \"The man tried, for the child's sake. But I\ndoubt he managed to make a completely aseptic transfer from the room\nshe lived in to the spaceport on Altaira. The authorities on Altaira\nshould have known it. They should have killed her and destroyed\neverything she'd touched. And _still_ the odds would have been bad!\"\n\nJensen said, \"But you can't do that, Nordenfeld! Not now!\"\n\n\"I shall take every measure that seems likely to be useful.\" Then\nNordenfeld snapped, \"Damnation, man! Do you realize that this\nchlorophage can wipe out the human race if it really gets loose? Do you\nthink I'll let sentiment keep me from doing what has to be done?\"\n\nHe flicked off the vision-phone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Star Queen_ came out of overdrive. Her skipper arranged it to be\ndone at the time when the largest possible number of her passengers\nand crew would be asleep. Those who were awake, of course, felt the\npeculiar inaudible sensation which one subjectively translated into\nsound. They felt the momentary giddiness which--having no natural\nparallel--feels like the sensation of treading on a stair-step that\nisn't there, combined with a twisting sensation so it is like a spiral\nfall. The passengers who were awake were mostly in the bars, and the\nbartenders explained that the ship had shifted overdrive generators and\nthere was nothing to it.\n\nThose who were asleep started awake, but there was nothing in their\nsurroundings to cause alarm. Some blinked in the darkness of their\ncabins and perhaps turned on the cabin lights, but everything seemed\nnormal. They turned off the lights again. Some babies cried and had to\nbe soothed. But there was nothing except wakening to alarm anybody.\nBabies went back to sleep and mothers returned to their beds and--such\nawakenings being customary--went back to sleep also.\n\nIt was natural enough. There were vague and commonplace noises,\ntogether making an indefinite hum. Fans circulated the ship's purified\nand reinvigorated air. Service motors turned in remote parts of the\nhull. Cooks and bakers moved about in the kitchens. Nobody could tell\nby any physical sensation that the _Star Queen_ was not in overdrive,\nexcept in the control room.\n\nThere the stars could be seen. They were unthinkably remote. The ship\nwas light-years from any place where humans lived. She did not drive.\nHer skipper had a family on Cassim. He would not land a plague ship\nwhich might destroy them. The executive officer had a small son. If\nhis return meant that small son's death as well as his own, he would\nnot return. All through the ship, the officers who had to know the\nsituation recognized that if chlorophage had gotten into the _Star\nQueen_, the ship must not land anywhere. Nobody could survive. Nobody\nmust attempt it.\n\nSo the huge liner hung in the emptiness between the stars, waiting\nuntil it could be known definitely that chlorophage was aboard or that\nwith absolute certainty it was absent. The question was up to Doctor\nNordenfeld.\n\nHe had isolated himself with Kathy in the ship's hospital compartment.\nSince the ship was built it had been used once by a grown man who\ndeveloped mumps, and once by an adolescent boy who developed a raging\nfever which antibiotics stopped. Health measures for space travel were\nstrict. The hospital compartment had only been used those two times.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn this voyage it had been used to contain an assortment of botanical\nspecimens from a planet seventy light-years beyond Regulus. They were\non their way to the botanical research laboratory on Cassim. As a\nroutine precaution they'd been placed in the hospital, which could\nbe fumigated when they were taken out. Now the doctor had piled them\nin one side of the compartment, which he had divided in half with a\ntransparent plastic sheet. He stayed in that side. Kathy occupied the\nother.\n\nShe had some flowering plants to look at and admire. They'd come from\nthe air room and she was delighted with their coloring and beauty.\nBut Doctor Nordenfeld had put them there as a continuing test for\nchlorophage. If Kathy carried that murderous virus on her person, the\nflowering plants would die of it--probably even before she did.\n\nIt was a scrupulously scientific test for the deadly stuff. Completely\nsealed off except for a circulator to freshen the air she breathed,\nKathy was settled with toys and picture books. It was an improvised\nbut well-designed germproof room. The air for Kathy to breathe was\nsterilized before it reached her. The air she had breathed was\nsterilized as it left her plastic-sided residence. It should be the\nperfection of protection for the ship--if it was not already too late.\n\nThe vision-phone buzzed. Doctor Nordenfeld stirred in his chair and\nflipped the switch. The _Star Queen's_ skipper looked at him out of the\nscreen.\n\n\"I've cut the overdrive,\" said the skipper. \"The passengers haven't\nbeen told.\"\n\n\"Very sensible,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"When will we know?\"\n\n\"That we can go on living? When the other possibility is exhausted.\"\n\n\"Then, how will we know?\" asked skipper stonily.\n\nDoctor Nordenfeld ticked off the possibilities. He bent down a finger.\n\"One, her father took great pains. Maybe he did manage an aseptic\ntransfer from a germ-free room to Altaira. Kathy may not have been\nexposed to the chlorophage. If she hasn't, no bleached spots will show\nup on the air-room foliage or among the flowering plants in the room\nwith her. Nobody in the crew or among the passengers will die.\"\n\nHe bent down a second finger. \"It is probably more likely that white\nspots will appear on the plants in the air room _and_ here, and people\nwill start to die. That will mean Kathy brought contagion here the\ninstant she arrived, and almost certainly that Altaira will become like\nKamerun--uninhabited. In such a case we are finished.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe bent down a third finger. \"Not so likely, but preferable, white\nspots may appear on the foliage inside the plastic with Kathy, but not\nin the ship's air room. In that case she was exposed, but the virus was\nincubating when she came on board, and only developed and spread after\nshe was isolated. Possibly, in such a case, we can save the passengers\nand crew, but the ship will probably have to be melted down in space.\nIt would be tricky, but it might be done.\"\n\nThe skipper hesitated. \"If that last happened, she--\"\n\n\"I will take whatever measures are necessary,\" said Doctor Nordenfeld.\n\"To save your conscience, we won't discuss them. They should have been\ntaken on Altaira.\"\n\nHe reached over and flipped off the phone. Then he looked up and into\nthe other part of the ship's hospital space. Kathy came out from behind\na screen, where she'd made ready for bed. She was beaming. She had a\nlarge picture book under one arm and a doll under the other.\n\n\"It's all right for me to have these with me, isn't it, Doctor\nNordenfeld?\" she asked hopefully. \"I didn't have any picture books but\none, and it got worn out. And my doll--it was dreadful how shabby she\nwas!\"\n\nThe doctor frowned. She smiled at him. He said, \"After all, picture\nbooks are made to be looked at and dolls to be played with.\"\n\nShe skipped to the tiny hospital bed on the far side of the presumably\nvirusproof partition. She climbed into it and zestfully arranged the\ndoll to share it. She placed the book within easy reach.\n\nShe said, \"I think my father would say you were very nice, Doctor\nNordenfeld, to look after me so well.\"\n\n\"No-o-o-o,\" said the doctor in a detached voice. \"I'm just doing what\nanybody ought to do.\"\n\nShe snuggled down under the covers. He looked at his watch and\nshrugged. It was very easy to confuse official night with official day,\nin space. Everybody else was asleep. He'd been putting Kathy through\ntests which began with measurements of pulse and respiration and\ntemperature and went on from there. Kathy managed them herself, under\nhis direction.\n\nHe settled down with one of the medical books he'd brought into\nthe isolation section with him. Its title was _Decontamination of\nInfectious Material from Different Planets_. He read it grimly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe time came when the _Star Queen_ should have come out of overdrive\nwith the sun Circe blazing fiercely nearby, and a green planet with\nice caps to be approached on interplanetary drive. There should have\nbeen droning, comforting drive noises to assure the passengers--who\nnaturally could not see beyond the ship's steel walls--that they were\nwithin a mere few million miles of a world where sunshine was normal,\nand skies were higher than ship's ceilings, and there were fascinating\nthings to see and do.\n\nSome of the passengers packed their luggage and put it outside their\ncabins to be picked up for landing. But no stewards came for it.\nPresently there was an explanation. The ship had run under maximum\nspeed and the planetfall would be delayed.\n\nThe passengers were disappointed but not concerned. The luggage\nvanished into cabins again.\n\nThe _Star Queen_ floated in space among a thousand thousand million\nstars. Her astrogators had computed a course to the nearest star into\nwhich to drive the _Star Queen_, but it would not be used unless there\nwas mutiny among the crew. It would be better to go in remote orbit\naround Circe III and give the news of chlorophage on Altaira, if Doctor\nNordenfeld reported it on the ship.\n\nTime passed. One day. Two. Three. Then Jensen called the hospital\ncompartment on vision-phone. His expression was dazed. Nordenfeld saw\nthe interior of the control room behind Jensen. He said, \"You're a\npassenger, Jensen. How is it you're in the control room?\"\n\nJensen moistened his lips. \"The skipper thought I'd better not\nassociate with the other passengers. I've stayed with the officers the\npast few days. We--the ones who know what's in prospect--we're keeping\nseparate from the others so--nobody will let anything out by accident.\"\n\n\"Very wise. When the skipper comes back on duty, ask him to call me.\nI've something interesting to tell him.\"\n\n\"He's--checking something now,\" said Jensen. His voice was thin and\nreedy. \"The--air officer reports there are white patches on the plants\nin the air room. They're growing. Fast. He told me to tell you.\nHe's--gone to make sure.\"\n\n\"No need,\" said Nordenfeld bitterly.\n\nHe swung the vision-screen. It faced that part of the hospital space\nbeyond the plastic sheeting. There were potted flowering plants there.\nThey had pleased Kathy. They shared her air. And there were white\npatches on their leaves.\n\n\"I thought,\" said Nordenfeld with an odd mirthless levity, \"that the\nskipper'd be interested. It is of no importance whatever now, but\nI accomplished something remarkable. Kathy's father didn't manage\nan aseptic transfer. She brought the chlorophage with her. But I\nconfined it. The plants on the far side of that plastic sheet show the\nchlorophage patches plainly. I expect Kathy to show signs of anemia\nshortly. I'd decided that drastic measures would have to be taken,\nand it looked like they might work, because I've confined the virus.\nIt's there where Kathy is, but it isn't where I am. All the botanical\nspecimens on my side of the sheet are untouched. The phage hasn't hit\nthem. It is remarkable. But it doesn't matter a damn if the air room's\ninfected. And I was so proud!\"\n\nJensen did not respond.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNordenfeld said ironically, \"Look what I accomplished! I protected\nthe air plants on my side See? They're beautifully green! No sign of\ninfection! It means that a man can work with chlorophage! A laboratory\nship could land on Kamerun and keep itself the equivalent of an\naseptic-environment room while the damned chlorophage was investigated\nand ultimately whipped! And it doesn't matter!\"\n\nJensen said numbly, \"We can't ever make port. We ought--we ought to--\"\n\n\"We'll take the necessary measures,\" Nordenfeld told him. \"Very quietly\nand very efficiently, with neither the crew nor the passengers knowing\nthat Altaira sent the chlorophage on board the _Star Queen_ in the hope\nof banishing it from there. The passengers won't know that their own\nofficials shipped it off with them as they tried to run away.... And\nI was so proud that I'd improvised an aseptic room to keep Kathy in! I\nsterilized the air that went in to her, and I sterilized--\"\n\nThen he stopped. He stopped quite short. He stared at the air unit, set\nup and with two pipes passing through the plastic partition which cut\nthe hospital space in two. He turned utterly white. He went roughly to\nthe air machine. He jerked back its cover. He put his hand inside.\n\nMinutes later he faced back to the vision-screen from which Jensen\nlooked apathetically at him.\n\n\"Tell the skipper to call me,\" he said in a savage tone. \"Tell him to\ncall me instantly he comes back! Before he issues any orders at all!\"\n\nHe bent over the sterilizing equipment and very carefully began to\ndisassemble it. He had it completely apart when Kathy waked. She peered\nat him through the plastic separation sheet.\n\n\"Good morning, Doctor Nordenfeld,\" she said cheerfully.\n\nThe doctor grunted. Kathy smiled at him. She had gotten on very good\nterms with the doctor, since she'd been kept in the ship's hospital.\nShe did not feel that she was isolated. In having the doctor where she\ncould talk to him at any time, she had much more company than ever\nbefore. She had read her entire picture book to him and discussed her\ndoll at length. She took it for granted that when he did not answer or\nfrowned that he was simply busy. But he was company because she could\nsee him.\n\nDoctor Nordenfeld put the air apparatus together with an extremely\npeculiar expression on his face. It had been built for Kathy's special\nisolation by a ship's mechanic. It should sterilize the used air going\ninto Kathy's part of the compartment, and it should sterilize the\nused air pushed out by the supplied fresh air. The hospital itself\nwas an independent sealed unit, with its own chemical air freshener,\nand it had been divided into two. The air freshener was where Doctor\nNordenfeld could attend to it, and the sterilizer pump simply shared\nthe freshening with Kathy. But--\n\nBut the pipe that pumped air to Kathy was brown and discolored from\nhaving been used for sterilizing, and the pipe that brought air back\nwas not. It was cold. It had never been heated.\n\nSo Doctor Nordenfeld had been exposed to any contagion Kathy could\nspread. He hadn't been protected at all. Yet the potted plants on\nKathy's side of the barrier were marked with great white splotches\nwhich grew almost as one looked, while the botanical specimens in the\ndoctor's part of the hospital--as much infected as Kathy's could have\nbeen, by failure of the ship's mechanic to build the sterilizer to work\ntwo ways: the stacked plants, the alien plants, the strange plants from\nseventy light-years beyond Regulus--they were vividly green. There\nwas no trace of chlorophage on them. Yet they had been as thoroughly\nexposed as Doctor Nordenfeld himself!\n\nThe doctor's hands shook. His eyes burned. He took out a surgeon's\nscalpel and ripped the plastic partition from floor to ceiling. Kathy\nwatched interestedly.\n\n\"Why did you do that, Doctor Nordenfeld?\" she asked.\n\nHe said in an emotionless, unnatural voice, \"I'm going to do something\nthat it was very stupid of me not to do before. It should have been\ndone when you were six years old, Kathy. It should have been done on\nKamerun, and after that on Altaira. Now we're going to do it here. You\ncan help me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Star Queen_ had floated out of overdrive long enough to throw all\ndistance computations off. But she swung about, and swam back, and\npresently she was not too far from the world where she was now many\ndays overdue. Lift-ships started up from the planet's surface. But the\n_Star Queen_ ordered them back.\n\n\"Get your spaceport health officer on the vision-phone,\" ordered the\n_Star Queen's_ skipper. \"We've had chlorophage on board.\"\n\nThere was panic. Even at a distance of a hundred thousand miles,\nchlorophage could strike stark terror into anybody. But presently the\nimage of the spaceport health officer appeared on the _Star Queen's_\nscreen.\n\n\"We're not landing,\" said Doctor Nordenfeld. \"There's almost certainly\nan outbreak of chlorophage on Altaira, and we're going back to do\nsomething about it. It got on our ship with passengers from there.\nWe've whipped it, but we may need some help.\"\n\nThe image of the health officer aground was a mask of horror for\nseconds after Nordenfeld's last statement. Then his expression became\nincredulous, though still horrified.\n\n\"We came on to here,\" said Doctor Nordenfeld, \"to get you to send\nword by the first other ship to the Patrol that a quarantine has\nto be set up on Altaira, and we need to be inspected for recovery\nfrom chlorophage infection. And we need to pass on, officially, the\ndiscovery that whipped the contagion on this ship. We were carrying\nbotanical specimens to Cassim and we discovered that they were immune\nto chlorophage. That's absurd, of course. Their green coloring is the\nsame substance as in plants under Sol-type suns anywhere. They couldn't\nbe immune to chlorophage. So there had to be something else.\"\n\n\"Was--was there?\" asked the health officer.\n\n\"There was. Those specimens came from somewhere beyond Regulus. They\ncarried, as normal symbiotes on their foliage, microÃ¶rganisms unknown\nboth on Kamerun and Altaira. The alien bugs are almost the size of\nvirus particles, feed on virus particles, and are carried by contact,\nair, and so on, as readily as virus particles themselves. We discovered\nthat those microÃ¶rganisms devoured chlorophage. We washed them off the\nleaves of the plants, sprayed them in our air-room jungle, and they\nmultiplied faster than the chlorophage. Our whole air supply is now\nloaded with an airborne antichlorophage organism which has made our\ncrew and passengers immune. We're heading back to Altaira to turn loose\nour merry little bugs on that planet. It appears that they grow on\ncertain vegetation, but they'll live anywhere there's phage to eat.\nWe're keeping some chlorophage cultures alive so our microÃ¶rganisms\ndon't die out for lack of food!\"\n\nThe medical officer on the ground gasped. \"Keeping phage _alive_?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hope you've recorded this,\" said Nordenfeld. \"It's rather important.\nThis trick should have been tried on Kamerun and Altaira and everywhere\nelse new diseases have turned up. When there's a bug on one planet\nthat's deadly to us, there's bound to be a bug on some other planet\nthat's deadly to it! The same goes for any pests or vermin--the\nprinciple of natural enemies. All we have to do is find the enemies!\"\n\nThere was more communication between the _Star Queen_ and the spaceport\non Circe III, which the _Star Queen_ would not make other contact with\non this trip, and presently the big liner headed back to Altaira. It\nwas necessary for official as well as humanitarian reasons. There would\nneed to be a health examination of the _Star Queen_ to certify that it\nwas safe for passengers to breathe her air and eat in her restaurants\nand swim in her swimming pools and occupy the six levels of passenger\ncabins she contained. This would have to be done by a Patrol ship,\nwhich would turn up at Altaira.\n\nThe _Star Queen's_ skipper would be praised by his owners for not\nhaving driven the liner into a star, and the purser would be forgiven\nfor the confusion in his records due to off-schedule operations of\nthe big ship, and Jensen would find in the ending of all terror of\nchlorophage an excellent reason to look for appreciation in the value\nof the investments he was checking up. And Doctor Nordenfeld....\n\nHe talked very gravely to Kathy. \"I'm afraid,\" he told her, \"that your\nfather isn't coming back. What would you like to do?\"\n\nShe smiled at him hopefully. \"Could I be your little girl?\" she asked.\nDoctor Nordenfeld grunted. \"Hm ... I'll think about it.\"\n\nBut he smiled at her. She grinned at him. And it was settled.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Doctor, by Murray Leinster",
