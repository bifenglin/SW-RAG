But each one has its proper hour in a conversation--you know\nthe pretty jest recorded by Chamfort, and said to the Duc de Fronsac:\n'Between your sally and the present moment lie ten bottles of\nchampagne.'\"\n\n\"But it is two in the morning, and the story of Rosina has prepared us,\"\nsaid the mistress of the house.\n\n\"Tell us, Monsieur Bianchon!\" was the cry on every side.\n\nThe obliging doctor bowed, and silence reigned.\n\n\"At about a hundred paces from Vendome, on the banks of the Loir,\" said\nhe, \"stands an old brown house, crowned with very high roofs, and so\ncompletely isolated that there is nothing near it, not even a fetid\ntannery or a squalid tavern, such as are commonly seen outside small\ntowns. In front of this house is a garden down to the river, where the\nbox shrubs, formerly clipped close to edge the walks, now straggle\nat their own will. A few willows, rooted in the stream, have grown\nup quickly like an enclosing fence, and half hide the house. The\nwild plants we call weeds have clothed the bank with their beautiful\nluxuriance. The fruit-trees, neglected for these ten years past,\nno longer bear a crop, and their suckers have formed a thicket. The\nespaliers are like a copse. The paths, once graveled, are overgrown with\npurslane; but, to be accurate there is no trace of a path.\n\n\"Looking down from the hilltop, to which cling the ruins of the old\ncastle of the Dukes of Vendome, the only spot whence the eye can\nsee into this enclosure, we think that at a time, difficult now to\ndetermine, this spot of earth must have been the joy of some country\ngentleman devoted to roses and tulips, in a word, to horticulture, but\nabove all a lover of choice fruit. An arbor is visible, or rather\nthe wreck of an arbor, and under it a table still stands not entirely\ndestroyed by time. At the aspect of this garden that is no more, the\nnegative joys of the peaceful life of the provinces may be divined as we\ndivine the history of a worthy tradesman when we read the epitaph on his\ntomb. To complete the mournful and tender impressions which seize the\nsoul, on one of the walls there is a sundial graced with this homely\nChristian motto, '_Ultimam cogita_.'\n\n\"The roof of this house is dreadfully dilapidated; the outside shutters\nare always closed; the balconies are hung with swallows' nests; the\ndoors are for ever shut. Straggling grasses have outlined the flagstones\nof the steps with green; the ironwork is rusty. Moon and sun, winter,\nsummer, and snow have eaten into the wood, warped the boards, peeled\noff the paint. The dreary silence is broken only by birds and cats,\npolecats, rats, and mice, free to scamper round, and fight, and eat each\nother. An invisible hand has written over it all: 'Mystery.'\n\n\"If, prompted by curiosity, you go to look at this house from the\nstreet, you will see a large gate, with a round-arched top; the children\nhave made many holes in it. I learned later that this door had been\nblocked for ten years. Through these irregular breaches you will see\nthat the side towards the courtyard is in perfect harmony with the side\ntowards the garden. The same ruin prevails. Tufts of weeds outline\nthe paving-stones; the walls are scored by enormous cracks, and the\nblackened coping is laced with a thousand festoons of pellitory. The\nstone steps are disjointed; the bell-cord is rotten; the gutter-spouts\nbroken. What fire from heaven could have fallen there? By what decree\nhas salt been sown on this dwelling? Has God been mocked here? Or was\nFrance betrayed? These are the questions we ask ourselves. Reptiles\ncrawl over it, but give no reply. This empty and deserted house is a\nvast enigma of which the answer is known to none.\n\n\"It was formerly a little domain, held in fief, and is known as La\nGrande Breteche. During my stay at Vendome, where Despleins had left me\nin charge of a rich patient, the sight of this strange dwelling became\none of my keenest pleasures. Was it not far better than a ruin? Certain\nmemories of indisputable authenticity attach themselves to a ruin; but\nthis house, still standing, though being slowly destroyed by an avenging\nhand, contained a secret, an unrevealed thought. At the very least,\nit testified to a caprice. More than once in the evening I boarded the\nhedge, run wild, which surrounded the enclosure. I braved scratches, I\ngot into this ownerless garden, this plot which was no longer public or\nprivate; I lingered there for hours gazing at the disorder. I would not,\nas the price of the story to which this strange scene no doubt was due,\nhave asked a single question of any gossiping native. On that spot I\nwove delightful romances, and abandoned myself to little debauches of\nmelancholy which enchanted me. If I had known the reason--perhaps quite\ncommonplace--of this neglect, I should have lost the unwritten poetry\nwhich intoxicated me. To me this refuge represented the most various\nphases of human life, shadowed by misfortune; sometimes the peace of the\ngraveyard without the dead, who speak in the language of epitaphs; one\nday I saw in it the home of lepers; another, the house of the Atridae;\nbut, above all, I found there provincial life, with its contemplative\nideas, its hour-glass existence. I often wept there, I never laughed.\n\n\"More than once I felt involuntary terrors as I heard overhead the dull\nhum of the wings of some hurrying wood-pigeon. The earth is dank; you\nmust be on the watch for lizards, vipers, and frogs, wandering about\nwith the wild freedom of nature; above all, you must have no fear\nof cold, for in a few moments you feel an icy cloak settle on your\nshoulders, like the Commendatore's hand on Don Giovanni's neck.\n\n\"One evening I felt a shudder; the wind had turned an old rusty\nweathercock, and the creaking sounded like a cry from the house, at\nthe very moment when I was finishing a gloomy drama to account for\nthis monumental embodiment of woe. I returned to my inn, lost in gloomy\nthoughts. When I had supped, the hostess came into my room with an air\nof mystery, and said, 'Monsieur, here is Monsieur Regnault.'\n\n\"'Who is Monsieur Regnault?'\n\n\"'What, sir, do you not know Monsieur Regnault?--Well, that's odd,' said\nshe, leaving the room.\n\n\"On a sudden I saw a man appear, tall, slim, dressed in black, hat\nin hand, who came in like a ram ready to butt his opponent, showing a\nreceding forehead, a small pointed head, and a colorless face of the hue\nof a glass of dirty water. You would have taken him for an usher. The\nstranger wore an old coat, much worn at the seams; but he had a diamond\nin his shirt frill, and gold rings in his ears.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said I, 'whom have I the honor of addressing?'--He took a\nchair, placed himself in front of my fire, put his hat on my table,\nand answered while he rubbed his hands: 'Dear me, it is very\ncold.--Monsieur, I am Monsieur Regnault.'\n\n\"I was encouraging myself by saying to myself, '_Il bondo cani!_ Seek!'\n\n\"'I am,' he went on, 'notary at Vendome.'\n\n\"'I am delighted to hear it, monsieur,' I exclaimed. 'But I am not in a\nposition to make a will for reasons best known to myself.'\n\n\"'One moment!' said he, holding up his hand as though to gain silence.\n'Allow me, monsieur, allow me! I am informed that you sometimes go to\nwalk in the garden of la Grande Breteche.'\n\n\"'Yes, monsieur.'\n\n\"'One moment!' said he, repeating his gesture. 'That constitutes a\nmisdemeanor. Monsieur, as executor under the will of the late Comtesse\nde Merret, I come in her name to beg you to discontinue the practice.\nOne moment! I am not a Turk, and do not wish to make a crime of it. And\nbesides, you are free to be ignorant of the circumstances which\ncompel me to leave the finest mansion in Vendome to fall into ruin.\nNevertheless, monsieur, you must be a man of education, and you should\nknow that the laws forbid, under heavy penalties, any trespass on\nenclosed property. A hedge is the same as a wall. But, the state in\nwhich the place is left may be an excuse for your curiosity. For my\npart, I should be quite content to make you free to come and go in the\nhouse; but being bound to respect the will of the testatrix, I have\nthe honor, monsieur, to beg that you will go into the garden no more.\nI myself, monsieur, since the will was read, have never set foot in the\nhouse, which, as I had the honor of informing you, is part of the estate\nof the late Madame de Merret. We have done nothing there but verify the\nnumber of doors and windows to assess the taxes I have to pay annually\nout of the funds left for that purpose by the late Madame de Merret. Ah!\nmy dear sir, her will made a great commotion in the town.'\n\n\"The good man paused to blow his nose. I respected his volubility,\nperfectly understanding that the administration of Madame de Merret's\nestate had been the most important event of his life, his reputation,\nhis glory, his Restoration. As I was forced to bid farewell to my\nbeautiful reveries and romances, I was to reject learning the truth on\nofficial authority.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said I, 'would it be indiscreet if I were to ask you the\nreasons for such eccentricity?'\n\n\"At these words an expression, which revealed all the pleasure which\nmen feel who are accustomed to ride a hobby, overspread the lawyer's\ncountenance. He pulled up the collar of his shirt with an air, took out\nhis snuffbox, opened it, and offered me a pinch; on my refusing, he took\na large one. He was happy! A man who has no hobby does not know all\nthe good to be got out of life. A hobby is the happy medium between a\npassion and a monomania. At this moment I understood the whole bearing\nof Sterne's charming passion, and had a perfect idea of the delight with\nwhich my uncle Toby, encouraged by Trim, bestrode his hobby-horse.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said Monsieur Regnault, 'I was head-clerk in Monsieur\nRoguin's office, in Paris. A first-rate house, which you may have heard\nmentioned? No! An unfortunate bankruptcy made it famous.--Not having\nmoney enough to purchase a practice in Paris at the price to which they\nwere run up in 1816, I came here and bought my predecessor's business.\nI had relations in Vendome; among others, a wealthy aunt, who allowed\nme to marry her daughter.--Monsieur,' he went on after a little pause,\n'three months after being licensed by the Keeper of the Seals, one\nevening, as I was going to bed--it was before my marriage--I was sent\nfor by Madame la Comtesse de Merret, to her Chateau of Merret. Her maid,\na good girl, who is now a servant in this inn, was waiting at my door\nwith the Countess' own carriage. Ah! one moment! I ought to tell you\nthat Monsieur le Comte de Merret had gone to Paris to die two months\nbefore I came here. He came to a miserable end, flinging himself into\nevery kind of dissipation. You understand?\n\n\"'On the day when he left, Madame la Comtesse had quitted la Grand\nBreteche, having dismantled it. Some people even say that she had\nburnt all the furniture, the hangings--in short, all the chattels and\nfurniture whatever used in furnishing the premises now let by the\nsaid M.--(Dear, what am I saying? I beg your pardon, I thought I was\ndictating a lease.)--In short, that she burnt everything in the meadow\nat Merret. Have you been to Merret, monsieur?--No,' said he, answering\nhimself, 'Ah, it is a very fine place.'\n\n\"'For about three months previously,' he went on, with a jerk of his\nhead, 'the Count and Countess had lived in a very eccentric way; they\nadmitted no visitors; Madame lived on the ground-floor, and Monsieur on\nthe first floor. When the Countess was left alone, she was never seen\nexcepting at church. Subsequently, at home, at the chateau, she refused\nto see the friends, whether gentlemen or ladies, who went to call on\nher. She was already very much altered when she left la Grande Breteche\nto go to Merret. That dear lady--I say dear lady, for it was she who\ngave me this diamond, but indeed I saw her but once--that kind lady was\nvery ill; she had, no doubt, given up all hope, for she died without\nchoosing to send for a doctor; indeed, many of our ladies fancied she\nwas not quite right in her head. Well, sir, my curiosity was strangely\nexcited by hearing that Madame de Merret had need of my services. Nor\nwas I the only person who took an interest in the affair. That very\nnight, though it was already late, all the town knew that I was going to\nMerret.\n\n\"'The waiting-woman replied but vaguely to the questions I asked her on\nthe way; nevertheless, she told me that her mistress had received the\nSacrament in the course of the day at the hands of the Cure of Merret,\nand seemed unlikely to live through the night. It was about eleven when\nI reached the chateau. I went up the great staircase. After crossing\nsome large, lofty, dark rooms, diabolically cold and damp, I reached the\nstate bedroom where the Countess lay. From the rumors that were current\nconcerning this lady (monsieur, I should never end if I were to repeat\nall the tales that were told about her), I had imagined her a coquette.\nImagine, then, that I had great difficulty in seeing her in the great\nbed where she was lying. To be sure, to light this enormous room, with\nold-fashioned heavy cornices, and so thick with dust that merely to see\nit was enough to make you sneeze, she had only an old Argand lamp. Ah!\nbut you have not been to Merret. Well, the bed is one of those old world\nbeds, with a high tester hung with flowered chintz. A small table stood\nby the bed, on which I saw an \"Imitation of Christ,\" which, by the\nway, I bought for my wife, as well as the lamp. There were also a deep\narmchair for her confidential maid, and two small chairs. There was no\nfire. That was all the furniture, not enough to fill ten lines in an\ninventory.\n\n\"'My dear sir, if you had seen, as I then saw, that vast room, papered\nand hung with brown, you would have felt yourself transported into a\nscene of a romance. It was icy, nay more, funereal,' and he lifted his\nhand with a theatrical gesture and paused.\n\n\"'By dint of seeking, as I approached the bed, at last I saw Madame de\nMerret, under the glimmer of the lamp, which fell on the pillows.\nHer face was as yellow as wax, and as narrow as two folded hands. The\nCountess had a lace cap showing her abundant hair, but as white as linen\nthread. She was sitting up in bed, and seemed to keep upright with\ngreat difficulty. Her large black eyes, dimmed by fever, no doubt,\nand half-dead already, hardly moved under the bony arch of her\neyebrows.--There,' he added, pointing to his own brow. 'Her forehead was\nclammy; her fleshless hands were like bones covered with soft skin;\nthe veins and muscles were perfectly visible. She must have been very\nhandsome; but at this moment I was startled into an indescribable\nemotion at the sight. Never, said those who wrapped her in her shroud,\nhad any living creature been so emaciated and lived. In short, it was\nawful to behold! Sickness so consumed that woman, that she was no more\nthan a phantom. Her lips, which were pale violet, seemed to me not to\nmove when she spoke to me.\n\n\"'Though my profession has familiarized me with such spectacles, by\ncalling me not infrequently to the bedside of the dying to record their\nlast wishes, I confess that families in tears and the agonies I have\nseen were as nothing in comparison with this lonely and silent woman in\nher vast chateau. I heard not the least sound, I did not perceive the\nmovement which the sufferer's breathing ought to have given to the\nsheets that covered her, and I stood motionless, absorbed in looking at\nher in a sort of stupor. In fancy I am there still. At last her large\neyes moved; she tried to raise her right hand, but it fell back on the\nbed, and she uttered these words, which came like a breath, for her\nvoice was no longer a voice: \"I have waited for you with the greatest\nimpatience.\" A bright flush rose to her cheeks. It was a great effort to\nher to speak.\n\n\"'\"Madame,\" I began. She signed to me to be silent. At that moment\nthe old housekeeper rose and said in my ear, \"Do not speak; Madame la\nComtesse is not in a state to bear the slightest noise, and what you say\nmight agitate her.\"\n\n\"'I sat down. A few instants after, Madame de Merret collected all her\nremaining strength to move her right hand, and slipped it, not without\ninfinite difficulty, under the bolster; she then paused a moment. With\na last effort she withdrew her hand; and when she brought out a sealed\npaper, drops of perspiration rolled from her brow. \"I place my will in\nyour hands--Oh! God! Oh!\" and that was all. She clutched a crucifix that\nlay on the bed, lifted it hastily to her lips, and died.\n\n\"'The expression of her eyes still makes me shudder as I think of it.\nShe must have suffered much! There was joy in her last glance, and it\nremained stamped on her dead eyes.\n\n\"'I brought away the will, and when it was opened I found that Madame de\nMerret had appointed me her executor. She left the whole of her property\nto the hospital at Vendome excepting a few legacies. But these were her\ninstructions as relating to la Grande Breteche: She ordered me to leave\nthe place, for fifty years counting from the day of her death, in the\nstate in which it might be at the time of her death, forbidding any one,\nwhoever he might be, to enter the apartments, prohibiting any repairs\nwhatever, and even settling a salary to pay watchmen if it were needful\nto secure the absolute fulfilment of her intentions. At the expiration\nof that term, if the will of the testatrix has been duly carried out,\nthe house is to become the property of my heirs, for, as you know, a\nnotary cannot take a bequest. Otherwise la Grande Breteche reverts to\nthe heirs-at-law, but on condition of fulfilling certain conditions\nset forth in a codicil to the will, which is not to be opened till\nthe expiration of the said term of fifty years. The will has not been\ndisputed, so----' And without finishing his sentence, the lanky notary\nlooked at me with an air of triumph; I made him quite happy by offering\nhim my congratulations.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' I said in conclusion, 'you have so vividly impressed\nme that I fancy I see the dying woman whiter than her sheets; her\nglittering eyes frighten me; I shall dream of her to-night.--But you\nmust have formed some idea as to the instructions contained in that\nextraordinary will.'\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said he, with comical reticence, 'I never allow myself\nto criticise the conduct of a person who honors me with the gift of a\ndiamond.'\n\n\"However, I soon loosened the tongue of the discreet notary of Vendome,\nwho communicated to me, not without long digressions, the opinions of\nthe deep politicians of both sexes whose judgments are law in Vendome.\nBut these opinions were so contradictory, so diffuse, that I was\nnear falling asleep in spite of the interest I felt in this authentic\nhistory. The notary's ponderous voice and monotonous accent, accustomed\nno doubt to listen to himself and to make himself listened to by his\nclients or fellow-townsmen, were too much for my curiosity. Happily, he\nsoon went away.\n\n\"'Ah, ha, monsieur,' said he on the stairs, 'a good many persons would\nbe glad to live five-and-forty years longer; but--one moment!' and he\nlaid the first finger of his right hand to his nostril with a cunning\nlook, as much as to say, 'Mark my words!--To last as long as that--as\nlong as that,' said he, 'you must not be past sixty now.'\n\n\"I closed my door, having been roused from my apathy by this last\nspeech, which the notary thought very funny; then I sat down in my\narmchair, with my feet on the fire-dogs. I had lost myself in a romance\n_a la_ Radcliffe, constructed on the juridical base given me by Monsieur\nRegnault, when the door, opened by a woman's cautious hand, turned on\nthe hinges. I saw my landlady come in, a buxom, florid dame, always\ngood-humored, who had missed her calling in life. She was a Fleming, who\nought to have seen the light in a picture by Teniers.\n\n\"'Well, monsieur,' said she, 'Monsieur Regnault has no doubt been giving\nyou his history of la Grande Breteche?'\n\n\"'Yes, Madame Lepas.'\n\n\"'And what did he tell you?'\n\n\"I repeated in a few words the creepy and sinister story of Madame de\nMerret. At each sentence my hostess put her head forward, looking at\nme with an innkeeper's keen scrutiny, a happy compromise between the\ninstinct of a police constable, the astuteness of a spy, and the cunning\nof a dealer.\n\n\"'My good Madame Lepas,' said I as I ended, 'you seem to know more about\nit. Heh? If not, why have you come up to me?'\n\n\"'On my word, as an honest woman----'\n\n\"'Do not swear; your eyes are big with a secret. You knew Monsieur de\nMerret; what sort of man was he?'\n\n\"'Monsieur de Merret--well, you see he was a man you never could see\nthe top of, he was so tall! A very good gentleman, from Picardy, and who\nhad, as we say, his head close to his cap. He paid for everything down,\nso as never to have difficulties with any one. He was hot-tempered, you\nsee! All our ladies liked him very much.'\n\n\"'Because he was hot-tempered?' I asked her.\n\n\"'Well, may be,' said she; 'and you may suppose, sir, that a man had to\nhave something to show for a figurehead before he could marry Madame de\nMerret, who, without any reflection on others, was the handsomest and\nrichest heiress in our parts. She had about twenty thousand francs\na year. All the town was at the wedding; the bride was pretty and\nsweet-looking, quite a gem of a woman. Oh, they were a handsome couple\nin their day!'\n\n\"'And were they happy together?'\n\n\"'Hm, hm! so-so--so far as can be guessed, for, as you may suppose, we\nof the common sort were not hail-fellow-well-met with them.--Madame de\nMerret was a kind woman and very pleasant, who had no doubt sometimes to\nput up with her husband's tantrums. But though he was rather haughty, we\nwere fond of him. After all, it was his place to behave so. When a man\nis a born nobleman, you see----'\n\n\"'Still, there must have been some catastrophe for Monsieur and Madame\nde Merret to part so violently?'\n\n\"'I did not say there was any catastrophe, sir. I know nothing about\nit.'\n\n\"'Indeed. Well, now, I am sure you know everything.'\n\n\"'Well, sir, I will tell you the whole story.--When I saw Monsieur\nRegnault go up to see you, it struck me that he would speak to you about\nMadame de Merret as having to do with la Grande Breteche. That put it\ninto my head to ask your advice, sir, seeming to me that you are a\nman of good judgment and incapable of playing a poor woman like me\nfalse--for I never did any one a wrong, and yet I am tormented by my\nconscience. Up to now I have never dared to say a word to the people of\nthese parts; they are all chatter-mags, with tongues like knives. And\nnever till now, sir, have I had any traveler here who stayed so long in\nthe inn as you have, and to whom I could tell the history of the fifteen\nthousand francs----'\n\n\"'My dear Madame Lepas, if there is anything in your story of a nature\nto compromise me,' I said, interrupting the flow of her words, 'I would\nnot hear it for all the world.'\n\n\"'You need have no fears,' said she; 'you will see.'\n\n\"Her eagerness made me suspect that I was not the only person to whom\nmy worthy landlady had communicated the secret of which I was to be the\nsole possessor, but I listened.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said she, 'when the Emperor sent the Spaniards here,\nprisoners of war and others, I was required to lodge at the charge\nof the Government a young Spaniard sent to Vendome on parole.\nNotwithstanding his parole, he had to show himself every day to the\nsub-prefect. He was a Spanish grandee--neither more nor less. He had\na name in _os_ and _dia_, something like Bagos de Feredia. I wrote his\nname down in my books, and you may see it if you like. Ah! he was a\nhandsome young fellow for a Spaniard, who are all ugly they say. He was\nnot more than five feet two or three in height, but so well made; and he\nhad little hands that he kept so beautifully! Ah! you should have\nseen them. He had as many brushes for his hands as a woman has for her\ntoilet. He had thick, black hair, a flame in his eye, a somewhat coppery\ncomplexion, but which I admired all the same. He wore the finest linen\nI have ever seen, though I have had princesses to lodge here, and, among\nothers, General Bertrand, the Duc and Duchesse d'Abrantes, Monsieur\nDescazes, and the King of Spain. He did not eat much, but he had such\npolite and amiable ways that it was impossible to owe him a grudge for\nthat. Oh! I was very fond of him, though he did not say four words to me\nin a day, and it was impossible to have the least bit of talk with him;\nif he was spoken to, he did not answer; it is a way, a mania they all\nhave, it would seem.\n\n\"'He read his breviary like a priest, and went to mass and all the\nservices quite regularly. And where did he post himself?--we found this\nout later.--Within two yards of Madame de Merret's chapel. As he took\nthat place the very first time he entered the church, no one imagined\nthat there was any purpose in it. Besides, he never raised his nose\nabove his book, poor young man! And then, monsieur, of an evening he\nwent for a walk on the hill among the ruins of the old castle. It was\nhis only amusement, poor man; it reminded him of his native land. They\nsay that Spain is all hills!\n\n\"'One evening, a few days after he was sent here, he was out very late.\nI was rather uneasy when he did not come in till just on the stroke of\nmidnight; but we all got used to his whims; he took the key of the door,\nand we never sat up for him. He lived in a house belonging to us in the\nRue des Casernes. Well, then, one of our stable-boys told us one evening\nthat, going down to wash the horses in the river, he fancied he had seen\nthe Spanish Grandee swimming some little way off, just like a fish. When\nhe came in, I told him to be careful of the weeds, and he seemed put out\nat having been seen in the water.\n\n\"'At last, monsieur, one day, or rather one morning, we did not find\nhim in his room; he had not come back. By hunting through his things, I\nfound a written paper in the drawer of his table, with fifty pieces of\nSpanish gold of the kind they call doubloons, worth about five thousand\nfrancs; and in a little sealed box ten thousand francs worth of\ndiamonds. The paper said that in case he should not return, he left us\nthis money and these diamonds in trust to found masses to thank God for\nhis escape and for his salvation.\n\n\"'At that time I still had my husband, who ran off in search of him.\nAnd this is the queer part of the story: he brought back the Spaniard's\nclothes, which he had found under a big stone on a sort of breakwater\nalong the river bank, nearly opposite la Grande Breteche. My husband\nwent so early that no one saw him. After reading the letter, he burnt\nthe clothes, and, in obedience to Count Feredia's wish, we announced\nthat he had escaped.\n\n\"'The sub-prefect set all the constabulary at his heels; but, pshaw! he\nwas never caught. Lepas believed that the Spaniard had drowned himself.\nI, sir, have never thought so; I believe, on the contrary, that he had\nsomething to do with the business about Madame de Merret, seeing that\nRosalie told me that the crucifix her mistress was so fond of that she\nhad it buried with her, was made of ebony and silver; now in the early\ndays of his stay here, Monsieur Feredia had one of ebony and silver\nwhich I never saw later.--And now, monsieur, do not you say that I need\nhave no remorse about the Spaniard's fifteen thousand francs? Are they\nnot really and truly mine?'\n\n\"'Certainly.--But have you never tried to question Rosalie?' said I.\n\n\"'Oh, to be sure I have, sir. But what is to be done? That girl is like\na wall. She knows something, but it is impossible to make her talk.'\n\n\"After chatting with me for a few minutes, my hostess left me a prey\nto vague and sinister thoughts, to romantic curiosity, and a religious\ndread, not unlike the deep emotion which comes upon us when we go into a\ndark church at night and discern a feeble light glimmering under a lofty\nvault--a dim figure glides across--the sweep of a gown or of a priest's\ncassock is audible--and we shiver! La Grande Breteche, with its rank\ngrasses, its shuttered windows, its rusty iron-work, its locked doors,\nits deserted rooms, suddenly rose before me in fantastic vividness. I\ntried to get into the mysterious dwelling to search out the heart of\nthis solemn story, this drama which had killed three persons.\n\n\"Rosalie became in my eyes the most interesting being in Vendome. As\nI studied her, I detected signs of an inmost thought, in spite of the\nblooming health that glowed in her dimpled face. There was in her soul\nsome element of ruth or of hope; her manner suggested a secret, like\nthe expression of devout souls who pray in excess, or of a girl who has\nkilled her child and for ever hears its last cry. Nevertheless, she was\nsimple and clumsy in her ways; her vacant smile had nothing criminal\nin it, and you would have pronounced her innocent only from seeing the\nlarge red and blue checked kerchief that covered her stalwart bust,\ntucked into the tight-laced bodice of a lilac- and white-striped gown.\n'No,' said I to myself, 'I will not quit Vendome without knowing the\nwhole history of la Grande Breteche. To achieve this end, I will make\nlove to Rosalie if it proves necessary.'\n\n\"'Rosalie!' said I one evening.\n\n\"'Your servant, sir?'\n\n\"'You are not married?' She started a little.\n\n\"'Oh! there is no lack of men if ever I take a fancy to be miserable!'\nshe replied, laughing. She got over her agitation at once; for every\nwoman, from the highest lady to the inn-servant inclusive, has a native\npresence of mind.\n\n\"'Yes; you are fresh and good-looking enough never to lack lovers! But\ntell me, Rosalie, why did you become an inn-servant on leaving Madame de\nMerret? Did she not leave you some little annuity?'\n\n\"'Oh yes, sir. But my place here is the best in all the town of\nVendome.'\n\n\"This reply was such an one as judges and attorneys call evasive.\nRosalie, as it seemed to me, held in this romantic affair the place of\nthe middle square of the chess-board: she was at the very centre of the\ninterest and of the truth; she appeared to me to be tied into the knot\nof it. It was not a case for ordinary love-making; this girl contained\nthe last chapter of a romance, and from that moment all my attentions\nwere devoted to Rosalie. By dint of studying the girl, I observed in\nher, as in every woman whom we make our ruling thought, a variety of\ngood qualities; she was clean and neat; she was handsome, I need not\nsay; she soon was possessed of every charm that desire can lend to a\nwoman in whatever rank of life. A fortnight after the notary's visit,\none evening, or rather one morning, in the small hours, I said to\nRosalie:\n\n\"'Come, tell me all you know about Madame de Merret.'\n\n\"'Oh!' she said, 'I will tell you; but keep the secret carefully.'\n\n\"'All right, my child; I will keep all your secrets with a thief's\nhonor, which is the most loyal known.'\n\n\"'If it is all the same to you,' said she, 'I would rather it should be\nwith your own.'\n\n\"Thereupon she set her head-kerchief straight, and settled herself to\ntell the tale; for there is no doubt a particular attitude of confidence\nand security is necessary to the telling of a narrative. The best tales\nare told at a certain hour--just as we are all here at table. No one\never told a story well standing up, or fasting.\n\n\"If I were to reproduce exactly Rosalie's diffuse eloquence, a whole\nvolume would scarcely contain it. Now, as the event of which she gave me\na confused account stands exactly midway between the notary's gossip and\nthat of Madame Lepas, as precisely as the middle term of a rule-of-three\nsum stands between the first and third, I have only to relate it in as\nfew words as may be. I shall therefore be brief.\n\n\"The room at la Grande Breteche in which Madame de Merret slept was on\nthe ground floor; a little cupboard in the wall, about four feet deep,\nserved her to hang her dresses in. Three months before the evening of\nwhich I have to relate the events, Madame de Merret had been seriously\nailing, so much so that her husband had left her to herself, and had his\nown bedroom on the first floor. By one of those accidents which it is\nimpossible to foresee, he came in that evening two hours later than\nusual from the club, where he went to read the papers and talk politics\nwith the residents in the neighborhood. His wife supposed him to have\ncome in, to be in bed and asleep. But the invasion of France had been\nthe subject of a very animated discussion; the game of billiards had\nwaxed vehement; he had lost forty francs, an enormous sum at Vendome,\nwhere everybody is thrifty, and where social habits are restrained\nwithin the bounds of a simplicity worthy of all praise, and the\nfoundation perhaps of a form of true happiness which no Parisian would\ncare for.\n\n\"For some time past Monsieur de Merret had been satisfied to ask Rosalie\nwhether his wife was in bed; on the girl's replying always in the\naffirmative, he at once went to his own room, with the good faith that\ncomes of habit and confidence. But this evening, on coming in, he took\nit into his head to go to see Madame de Merret, to tell her of his\nill-luck, and perhaps to find consolation. During dinner he had observed\nthat his wife was very becomingly dressed; he reflected as he came\nhome from the club that his wife was certainly much better, that\nconvalescence had improved her beauty, discovering it, as husbands\ndiscover everything, a little too late. Instead of calling Rosalie,\nwho was in the kitchen at the moment watching the cook and the coachman\nplaying a puzzling hand at cards, Monsieur de Merret made his way to his\nwife's room by the light of his lantern, which he set down at the lowest\nstep of the stairs. His step, easy to recognize, rang under the vaulted\npassage.\n\n\"At the instant when the gentleman turned the key to enter his wife's\nroom, he fancied he heard the door shut of the closet of which I have\nspoken; but when he went in, Madame de Merret was alone, standing in\nfront of the fireplace. The unsuspecting husband fancied that Rosalie\nwas in the cupboard; nevertheless, a doubt, ringing in his ears like a\npeal of bells, put him on his guard; he looked at his wife, and read in\nher eyes an indescribably anxious and haunted expression.\n\n\"'You are very late,' said she.--Her voice, usually so clear and sweet,\nstruck him as being slightly husky.\n\n\"Monsieur de Merret made no reply, for at this moment Rosalie came in.\nThis was like a thunder-clap. He walked up and down the room, going from\none window to another at a regular pace, his arms folded.\n\n\"'Have you had bad news, or are you ill?' his wife asked him timidly,\nwhile Rosalie helped her to undress. He made no reply.\n\n\"'You can go, Rosalie,' said Madame de Merret to her maid; 'I can put in\nmy curl-papers myself.'--She scented disaster at the mere aspect of her\nhusband's face, and wished to be alone with him. As soon as Rosalie\nwas gone, or supposed to be gone, for she lingered a few minutes in the\npassage, Monsieur de Merret came and stood facing his wife, and said\ncoldly, 'Madame, there is some one in your cupboard!' She looked at her\nhusband calmly, and replied quite simply, 'No, monsieur.'\n\n\"This 'No' wrung Monsieur de Merret's heart; he did not believe it; and\nyet his wife had never appeared purer or more saintly than she seemed\nto be at this moment. He rose to go and open the closet door. Madame de\nMerret took his hand, stopped him, looked at him sadly, and said in a\nvoice of strange emotion, 'Remember, if you should find no one there,\neverything must be at an end between you and me.'\n\n\"The extraordinary dignity of his wife's attitude filled him with deep\nesteem for her, and inspired him with one of those resolves which need\nonly a grander stage to become immortal.\n\n\"'No, Josephine,' he said, 'I will not open it. In either event we\nshould be parted for ever. Listen; I know all the purity of your soul, I\nknow you lead a saintly life, and would not commit a deadly sin to save\nyour life.'--At these words Madame de Merret looked at her husband with\na haggard stare.--'See, here is your crucifix,' he went on. 'Swear to\nme before God that there is no one in there; I will believe you--I will\nnever open that door.'\n\n\"Madame de Merret took up the crucifix and said, 'I swear it.'\n\n\"'Louder,' said her husband; 'and repeat: \"I swear before God that there\nis nobody in that closet.\"' She repeated the words without flinching.\n\n\"'That will do,' said Monsieur de Merret coldly. After a moment's\nsilence: 'You have there a fine piece of work which I never saw before,'\nsaid he, examining the crucifix of ebony and silver, very artistically\nwrought.\n\n\"'I found it at Duvivier's; last year when that troop of Spanish\nprisoners came through Vendome, he bought it of a Spanish monk.'\n\n\"'Indeed,' said Monsieur de Merret, hanging the crucifix on its nail;\nand he rang the bell.\n\n\"He had to wait for Rosalie. Monsieur de Merret went forward quickly\nto meet her, led her into the bay of the window that looked on to the\ngarden, and said to her in an undertone:\n\n\"'I know that Gorenflot wants to marry you, that poverty alone prevents\nyour setting up house, and that you told him you would not be his wife\ntill he found means to become a master mason.--Well, go and fetch him;\ntell him to come here with his trowel and tools. Contrive to wake no one\nin his house but himself. His reward will be beyond your wishes. Above\nall, go out without saying a word--or else!' and he frowned.\n\n\"Rosalie was going, and he called her back. 'Here, take my latch-key,'\nsaid he.\n\n\"'Jean!' Monsieur de Merret called in a voice of thunder down the\npassage. Jean, who was both coachman and confidential servant, left his\ncards and came.\n\n\"'Go to bed, all of you,' said his master, beckoning him to come close;\nand the gentleman added in a whisper, 'When they are all asleep--mind,\n_asleep_--you understand?--come down and tell me.'\n\n\"Monsieur de Merret, who had never lost sight of his wife while giving\nhis orders, quietly came back to her at the fireside, and began to tell\nher the details of the game of billiards and the discussion at the club.\nWhen Rosalie returned she found Monsieur and Madame de Merret conversing\namiably.\n\n\"Not long before this Monsieur de Merret had had new ceilings made to\nall the reception-rooms on the ground floor. Plaster is very scarce at\nVendome; the price is enhanced by the cost of carriage; the gentleman\nhad therefore had a considerable quantity delivered to him, knowing\nthat he could always find purchasers for what might be left. It was this\ncircumstance which suggested the plan he carried out.\n\n\"'Gorenflot is here, sir,' said Rosalie in a whisper.\n\n\"'Tell him to come in,' said her master aloud.\n\n\"Madame de Merret turned paler when she saw the mason.\n\n\"'Gorenflot,' said her husband, 'go and fetch some bricks from the\ncoach-house; bring enough to wall up the door of this cupboard; you can\nuse the plaster that is left for cement.' Then, dragging Rosalie and the\nworkman close to him--'Listen, Gorenflot,' said he, in a low voice,\n'you are to sleep here to-night; but to-morrow morning you shall have a\npassport to take you abroad to a place I will tell you of. I will give\nyou six thousand francs for your journey. You must live in that town for\nten years; if you find you do not like it, you may settle in another,\nbut it must be in the same country. Go through Paris and wait there till\nI join you. I will there give you an agreement for six thousand francs\nmore, to be paid to you on your return, provided you have carried out\nthe conditions of the bargain. For that price you are to keep perfect\nsilence as to what you have to do this night. To you, Rosalie, I will\nsecure ten thousand francs, which will not be paid to you till your\nwedding day, and on condition of your marrying Gorenflot; but, to get\nmarried, you must hold your tongue. If not, no wedding gift!'\n\n\"'Rosalie,' said Madame de Merret, 'come and brush my hair.'\n\n\"Her husband quietly walked up and down the room, keeping an eye on the\ndoor, on the mason, and on his wife, but without any insulting display\nof suspicion. Gorenflot could not help making some noise. Madame de\nMerret seized a moment when he was unloading some bricks, and when her\nhusband was at the other end of the room to say to Rosalie: 'My dear\nchild, I will give you a thousand francs a year if only you will tell\nGorenflot to leave a crack at the bottom.' Then she added aloud quite\ncoolly: 'You had better help him.'\n\n\"Monsieur and Madame de Merret were silent all the time while Gorenflot\nwas walling up the door. This silence was intentional on the husband's\npart; he did not wish to give his wife the opportunity of saying\nanything with a double meaning. On Madame de Merret's side it was pride\nor prudence. When the wall was half built up the cunning mason took\nadvantage of his master's back being turned to break one of the two\npanes in the top of the door with a blow of his pick. By this Madame de\nMerret understood that Rosalie had spoken to Gorenflot. They all three\nthen saw the face of a dark, gloomy-looking man, with black hair and\nflaming eyes.\n\n\"Before her husband turned round again the poor woman had nodded to the\nstranger, to whom the signal was meant to convey, 'Hope.'\n\n\"At four o'clock, as the day was dawning, for it was the month of\nSeptember, the work was done. The mason was placed in charge of Jean,\nand Monsieur de Merret slept in his wife's room.\n\n\"Next morning when he got up he said with apparent carelessness, 'Oh,\nby the way, I must go to the Maire for the passport.' He put on his hat,\ntook two or three steps towards the door, paused, and took the crucifix.\nHis wife was trembling with joy.\n\n\"'He will go to Duvivier's,' thought she.\n\n\"As soon as he had left, Madame de Merret rang for Rosalie, and then in\na terrible voice she cried: 'The pick! Bring the pick! and set to work.\nI saw how Gorenflot did it yesterday; we shall have time to make a gap\nand build it up again.'\n\n\"In an instant Rosalie had brought her mistress a sort of cleaver; she,\nwith a vehemence of which no words can give an idea, set to work to\ndemolish the wall. She had already got out a few bricks, when, turning\nto deal a stronger blow than before, she saw behind her Monsieur de\nMerret. She fainted away.\n\n\"'Lay madame on her bed,' said he coldly.\n\n\"Foreseeing what would certainly happen in his absence, he had laid\nthis trap for his wife; he had merely written to the Maire and sent for\nDuvivier. The jeweler arrived just as the disorder in the room had been\nrepaired.\n\n\"'Duvivier,' asked Monsieur de Merret, 'did not you buy some crucifixes\nof the Spaniards who passed through the town?'\n\n\"'No, monsieur.'\n\n\"'Very good; thank you,' said he, flashing a tiger's glare at his wife.\n'Jean,' he added, turning to his confidential valet, 'you can serve my\nmeals here in Madame de Merret's room. She is ill, and I shall not leave\nher till she recovers.'\n\n\"The cruel man remained in his wife's room for twenty days. During\nthe earlier time, when there was some little noise in the closet,\nand Josephine wanted to intercede for the dying man, he said, without\nallowing her to utter a word, 'You swore on the Cross that there was no\none there.'\"\n\n\nAfter this story all the ladies rose from table, and thus the spell\nunder which Bianchon had held them was broken.
