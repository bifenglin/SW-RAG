    "context": "Produced by Judith Boss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnoch Soames\n\nA Memory of the Eighteen-nineties\n\n\nBy\n\nMAX BEERBOHM\n\n\n\nWhen a book about the literature of the eighteen-nineties was given by\nMr. Holbrook Jackson to the world, I looked eagerly in the index for\nSoames, Enoch.  It was as I feared: he was not there.  But everybody\nelse was.  Many writers whom I had quite forgotten, or remembered but\nfaintly, lived again for me, they and their work, in Mr. Holbrook\nJackson's pages.  The book was as thorough as it was brilliantly\nwritten.  And thus the omission found by me was an all the deadlier\nrecord of poor Soames's failure to impress himself on his decade.\n\nI dare say I am the only person who noticed the omission.  Soames had\nfailed so piteously as all that!  Nor is there a counterpoise in the\nthought that if he had had some measure of success he might have\npassed, like those others, out of my mind, to return only at the\nhistorian's beck.  It is true that had his gifts, such as they were,\nbeen acknowledged in his lifetime, he would never have made the bargain\nI saw him make--that strange bargain whose results have kept him always\nin the foreground of my memory.  But it is from those very results that\nthe full piteousness of him glares out.\n\nNot my compassion, however, impels me to write of him.  For his sake,\npoor fellow, I should be inclined to keep my pen out of the ink.  It is\nill to deride the dead.  And how can I write about Enoch Soames without\nmaking him ridiculous?  Or, rather, how am I to hush up the horrid fact\nthat he WAS ridiculous?  I shall not be able to do that.  Yet, sooner\nor later, write about him I must.  You will see in due course that I\nhave no option.  And I may as well get the thing done now.\n\nIn the summer term of '93 a bolt from the blue flashed down on Oxford.\nIt drove deep; it hurtlingly embedded itself in the soil.  Dons and\nundergraduates stood around, rather pale, discussing nothing but it.\nWhence came it, this meteorite?  From Paris.  Its name?  Will\nRothenstein. Its aim?  To do a series of twenty-four portraits in\nlithograph.  These were to be published from the Bodley Head, London.\nThe matter was urgent. Already the warden of A, and the master of B,\nand the Regius Professor of C had meekly \"sat.\"  Dignified and\ndoddering old men who had never consented to sit to any one could not\nwithstand this dynamic little stranger.  He did not sue; he invited: he\ndid not invite; he commanded.  He was twenty-one years old.  He wore\nspectacles that flashed more than any other pair ever seen.  He was a\nwit.  He was brimful of ideas.  He knew Whistler.  He knew Daudet and\nthe Goncourts.  He knew every one in Paris.  He knew them all by heart.\nHe was Paris in Oxford.  It was whispered that, so soon as he had\npolished off his selection of dons, he was going to include a few\nundergraduates.  It was a proud day for me when I--I was included.  I\nliked Rothenstein not less than I feared him; and there arose between\nus a friendship that has grown ever warmer, and been more and more\nvalued by me, with every passing year.\n\nAt the end of term he settled in, or, rather, meteoritically into,\nLondon.  It was to him I owed my first knowledge of that\nforever-enchanting little world-in-itself, Chelsea, and my first\nacquaintance with Walter Sickert and other August elders who dwelt\nthere.  It was Rothenstein that took me to see, in Cambridge Street,\nPimlico, a young man whose drawings were already famous among the\nfew--Aubrey Beardsley by name.  With Rothenstein I paid my first visit\nto the Bodley Head.  By him I was inducted into another haunt of\nintellect and daring, the domino-room of the Cafe Royal.\n\nThere, on that October evening--there, in that exuberant vista of\ngilding and crimson velvet set amidst all those opposing mirrors and\nupholding caryatids, with fumes of tobacco ever rising to the painted\nand pagan ceiling, and with the hum of presumably cynical conversation\nbroken into so sharply now and again by the clatter of dominoes\nshuffled on marble tables, I drew a deep breath and, \"This indeed,\"\nsaid I to myself, \"is life!\"  (Forgive me that theory.  Remember the\nwaging of even the South African War was not yet.)\n\nIt was the hour before dinner.  We drank vermuth.  Those who knew\nRothenstein were pointing him out to those who knew him only by name.\nMen were constantly coming in through the swing-doors and wandering\nslowly up and down in search of vacant tables or of tables occupied by\nfriends.  One of these rovers interested me because I was sure he\nwanted to catch Rothenstein's eye.  He had twice passed our table, with\na hesitating look; but Rothenstein, in the thick of a disquisition on\nPuvis de Chavannes, had not seen him.  He was a stooping, shambling\nperson, rather tall, very pale, with longish and brownish hair.  He had\na thin, vague beard, or, rather, he had a chin on which a large number\nof hairs weakly curled and clustered to cover its retreat.  He was an\nodd-looking person; but in the nineties odd apparitions were more\nfrequent, I think, than they are now.  The young writers of that\nera--and I was sure this man was a writer--strove earnestly to be\ndistinct in aspect.  This man had striven unsuccessfully.  He wore a\nsoft black hat of clerical kind, but of Bohemian intention, and a gray\nwaterproof cape which, perhaps because it was waterproof, failed to be\nromantic.  I decided that \"dim\" was the mot juste for him.  I had\nalready essayed to write, and was immensely keen on the mot juste, that\nHoly Grail of the period.\n\nThe dim man was now again approaching our table, and this time he made\nup his mind to pause in front of it.\n\n\"You don't remember me,\" he said in a toneless voice.\n\nRothenstein brightly focused him.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" he replied after a moment, with pride rather than\neffusion--pride in a retentive memory.  \"Edwin Soames.\"\n\n\"Enoch Soames,\" said Enoch.\n\n\"Enoch Soames,\" repeated Rothenstein in a tone implying that it was\nenough to have hit on the surname.  \"We met in Paris a few times when\nyou were living there.  We met at the Cafe Groche.\"\n\n\"And I came to your studio once.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I was sorry I was out.\"\n\n\"But you were in.  You showed me some of your paintings, you know.  I\nhear you're in Chelsea now.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI almost wondered that Mr. Soames did not, after this monosyllable,\npass along.  He stood patiently there, rather like a dumb animal,\nrather like a donkey looking over a gate.  A sad figure, his.  It\noccurred to me that \"hungry\" was perhaps the mot juste for him;\nbut--hungry for what?  He looked as if he had little appetite for\nanything.  I was sorry for him; and Rothenstein, though he had not\ninvited him to Chelsea, did ask him to sit down and have something to\ndrink.\n\nSeated, he was more self-assertive.  He flung back the wings of his\ncape with a gesture which, had not those wings been waterproof, might\nhave seemed to hurl defiance at things in general.  And he ordered an\nabsinthe.  \"Je me tiens toujours fidele,\" he told Rothenstein, \"a la\nsorciere glauque.\"\n\n\"It is bad for you,\" said Rothenstein, dryly.\n\n\"Nothing is bad for one,\" answered Soames.  \"Dans ce monde il n'y a ni\nbien ni mal.\"\n\n\"Nothing good and nothing bad?  How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I explained it all in the preface to 'Negations.'\"\n\n\"'Negations'?\"\n\n\"Yes, I gave you a copy of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, of course.  But, did you explain, for instance, that there\nwas no such thing as bad or good grammar?\"\n\n\"N-no,\" said Soames.  \"Of course in art there is the good and the evil.\nBut in life--no.\"  He was rolling a cigarette.  He had weak, white\nhands, not well washed, and with finger-tips much stained with\nnicotine.  \"In life there are illusions of good and evil, but\"--his\nvoice trailed away to a murmur in which the words \"vieux jeu\" and\n\"rococo\" were faintly audible.  I think he felt he was not doing\nhimself justice, and feared that Rothenstein was going to point out\nfallacies.  Anyhow, he cleared his throat and said, \"Parlons d'autre\nchose.\"\n\nIt occurs to you that he was a fool?  It didn't to me.  I was young,\nand had not the clarity of judgment that Rothenstein already had.\nSoames was quite five or six years older than either of us.  Also--he\nhad written a book.  It was wonderful to have written a book.\n\nIf Rothenstein had not been there, I should have revered Soames.  Even\nas it was, I respected him.  And I was very near indeed to reverence\nwhen he said he had another book coming out soon.  I asked if I might\nask what kind of book it was to be.\n\n\"My poems,\" he answered.  Rothenstein asked if this was to be the title\nof the book.  The poet meditated on this suggestion, but said he rather\nthought of giving the book no title at all.  \"If a book is good in\nitself--\" he murmured, and waved his cigarette.\n\nRothenstein objected that absence of title might be bad for the sale of\na book.\n\n\"If,\" he urged, \"I went into a bookseller's and said simply, 'Have you\ngot?' or, 'Have you a copy of?' how would they know what I wanted?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course I should have my name on the cover,\" Soames answered\nearnestly.  \"And I rather want,\" he added, looking hard at Rothenstein,\n\"to have a drawing of myself as frontispiece.\"  Rothenstein admitted\nthat this was a capital idea, and mentioned that he was going into the\ncountry and would be there for some time.  He then looked at his watch,\nexclaimed at the hour, paid the waiter, and went away with me to\ndinner.  Soames remained at his post of fidelity to the glaucous witch.\n\n\"Why were you so determined not to draw him?\" I asked.\n\n\"Draw him?  Him?  How can one draw a man who doesn't exist?\"\n\n\"He is dim,\" I admitted.  But my mot juste fell flat.  Rothenstein\nrepeated that Soames was non-existent.\n\nStill, Soames had written a book.  I asked if Rothenstein had read\n\"Negations.\"  He said he had looked into it, \"but,\" he added crisply,\n\"I don't profess to know anything about writing.\"  A reservation very\ncharacteristic of the period!  Painters would not then allow that any\none outside their own order had a right to any opinion about painting.\nThis law (graven on the tablets brought down by Whistler from the\nsummit of Fuji-yama) imposed certain limitations.  If other arts than\npainting were not utterly unintelligible to all but the men who\npracticed them, the law tottered--the Monroe Doctrine, as it were, did\nnot hold good.  Therefore no painter would offer an opinion of a book\nwithout warning you at any rate that his opinion was worthless.  No one\nis a better judge of literature than Rothenstein; but it wouldn't have\ndone to tell him so in those days, and I knew that I must form an\nunaided judgment of \"Negations.\"\n\nNot to buy a book of which I had met the author face to face would have\nbeen for me in those days an impossible act of self-denial.  When I\nreturned to Oxford for the Christmas term I had duly secured\n\"Negations.\"  I used to keep it lying carelessly on the table in my\nroom, and whenever a friend took it up and asked what it was about, I\nwould say: \"Oh, it's rather a remarkable book.  It's by a man whom I\nknow.\" Just \"what it was about\" I never was able to say.  Head or tail\nwas just what I hadn't made of that slim, green volume.  I found in the\npreface no clue to the labyrinth of contents, and in that labyrinth\nnothing to explain the preface.\n\n\n  Lean near to life.  Lean very near--\n  nearer.\n\n  Life is web and therein nor warp nor\n  woof is, but web only.\n\n  It is for this I am Catholick in church\n  and in thought, yet do let swift Mood weave\n  there what the shuttle of Mood wills.\n\n\nThese were the opening phrases of the preface, but those which followed\nwere less easy to understand.  Then came \"Stark: A Conte,\" about a\nmidinette who, so far as I could gather, murdered, or was about to\nmurder, a mannequin.  It was rather like a story by Catulle Mendes in\nwhich the translator had either skipped or cut out every alternate\nsentence.  Next, a dialogue between Pan and St. Ursula, lacking, I\nrather thought, in \"snap.\" Next, some aphorisms (entitled \"Aphorismata\"\n[spelled in Greek]).  Throughout, in fact, there was a great variety of\nform, and the forms had evidently been wrought with much care.  It was\nrather the substance that eluded me.  Was there, I wondered, any\nsubstance at all?  It did now occur to me: suppose Enoch Soames was a\nfool!  Up cropped a rival hypothesis: suppose _I_ was!  I inclined to\ngive Soames the benefit of the doubt.  I had read \"L'Apres-midi d'un\nfaune\" without extracting a glimmer of meaning; yet Mallarme, of\ncourse, was a master.  How was I to know that Soames wasn't another?\nThere was a sort of music in his prose, not indeed, arresting, but\nperhaps, I thought, haunting, and laden, perhaps, with meanings as deep\nas Mallarme's own.  I awaited his poems with an open mind.\n\nAnd I looked forward to them with positive impatience after I had had a\nsecond meeting with him.  This was on an evening in January.  Going\ninto the aforesaid domino-room, I had passed a table at which sat a\npale man with an open book before him.  He had looked from his book to\nme, and I looked back over my shoulder with a vague sense that I ought\nto have recognized him.  I returned to pay my respects.  After\nexchanging a few words, I said with a glance to the open book, \"I see I\nam interrupting you,\" and was about to pass on, but, \"I prefer,\" Soames\nreplied in his toneless voice, \"to be interrupted,\" and I obeyed his\ngesture that I should sit down.\n\nI asked him if he often read here.\n\n\"Yes; things of this kind I read here,\" he answered, indicating the\ntitle of his book--\"The Poems of Shelley.\"\n\n\"Anything that you really\"--and I was going to say \"admire?\"  But I\ncautiously left my sentence unfinished, and was glad that I had done\nso, for he said with unwonted emphasis, \"Anything second-rate.\"\n\nI had read little of Shelley, but, \"Of course,\" I murmured, \"he's very\nuneven.\"\n\n\"I should have thought evenness was just what was wrong with him.  A\ndeadly evenness.  That's why I read him here.  The noise of this place\nbreaks the rhythm.  He's tolerable here.\"  Soames took up the book and\nglanced through the pages.  He laughed.  Soames's laugh was a short,\nsingle, and mirthless sound from the throat, unaccompanied by any\nmovement of the face or brightening of the eyes.  \"What a period!\" he\nuttered, laying the book down.  And, \"What a country!\" he added.\n\nI asked rather nervously if he didn't think Keats had more or less held\nhis own against the drawbacks of time and place.  He admitted that\nthere were \"passages in Keats,\" but did not specify them.  Of \"the\nolder men,\" as he called them, he seemed to like only Milton.\n\"Milton,\" he said, \"wasn't sentimental.\"  Also, \"Milton had a dark\ninsight.\"  And again, \"I can always read Milton in the reading-room.\"\n\n\"The reading-room?\"\n\n\"Of the British Museum.  I go there every day.\"\n\n\"You do?  I've only been there once.  I'm afraid I found it rather a\ndepressing place.  It--it seemed to sap one's vitality.\"\n\n\"It does.  That's why I go there.  The lower one's vitality, the more\nsensitive one is to great art.  I live near the museum.  I have rooms\nin Dyott Street.\"\n\n\"And you go round to the reading-room to read Milton?\"\n\n\"Usually Milton.\"  He looked at me.  \"It was Milton,\" he\ncertificatively added, \"who converted me to diabolism.\"\n\n\"Diabolism?  Oh, yes?  Really?\" said I, with that vague discomfort and\nthat intense desire to be polite which one feels when a man speaks of\nhis own religion.  \"You--worship the devil?\"\n\nSoames shook his head.\n\n\"It's not exactly worship,\" he qualified, sipping his absinthe.  \"It's\nmore a matter of trusting and encouraging.\"\n\n\"I see, yes.  I had rather gathered from the preface to 'Negations'\nthat you were a--a Catholic.\"\n\n\"Je l'etais a cette epoque.  In fact, I still am.  I am a Catholic\ndiabolist.\"\n\nBut this profession he made in an almost cursory tone.  I could see\nthat what was upmost in his mind was the fact that I had read\n\"Negations.\"  His pale eyes had for the first time gleamed.  I felt as\none who is about to be examined viva voce on the very subject in which\nhe is shakiest.  I hastily asked him how soon his poems were to be\npublished.\n\n\"Next week,\" he told me.\n\n\"And are they to be published without a title?\"\n\n\"No.  I found a title at last.  But I sha'n't tell you what it is,\" as\nthough I had been so impertinent as to inquire.  \"I am not sure that it\nwholly satisfies me.  But it is the best I can find.  It suggests\nsomething of the quality of the poems--strange growths, natural and\nwild, yet exquisite,\" he added, \"and many-hued, and full of poisons.\"\n\nI asked him what he thought of Baudelaire.  He uttered the snort that\nwas his laugh, and, \"Baudelaire,\" he said, \"was a bourgeois malgre\nlui.\"  France had had only one poet--Villon; \"and two thirds of Villon\nwere sheer journalism.\"  Verlaine was \"an epicier malgre lui.\"\nAltogether, rather to my surprise, he rated French literature lower\nthan English.  There were \"passages\" in Villiers de l'Isle-Adam.  But,\n\"I,\" he summed up, \"owe nothing to France.\"  He nodded at me.  \"You'll\nsee,\" he predicted.\n\nI did not, when the time came, quite see that.  I thought the author of\n\"Fungoids\" did, unconsciously of course, owe something to the young\nParisian decadents or to the young English ones who owed something to\nTHEM.  I still think so.  The little book, bought by me in Oxford, lies\nbefore me as I write.  Its pale-gray buckram cover and silver lettering\nhave not worn well.  Nor have its contents.  Through these, with a\nmelancholy interest, I have again been looking.  They are not much.\nBut at the time of their publication I had a vague suspicion that they\nMIGHT be.  I suppose it is my capacity for faith, not poor Soames's\nwork, that is weaker than it once was.\n\n\n  TO A YOUNG WOMAN\n\n  THOU ART, WHO HAST NOT BEEN!\n\n  Pale tunes irresolute\n\n  And traceries of old sounds\n\n  Blown from a rotted flute\n  Mingle with noise of cymbals rouged with rust,\n  Nor not strange forms and epicene\n\n  Lie bleeding in the dust,\n\n  Being wounded with wounds.\n\n  For this it is\n  That in thy counterpart\n\n  Of age-long mockeries\n  THOU HAST NOT BEEN NOR ART!\n\n\nThere seemed to me a certain inconsistency as between the first and\nlast lines of this.  I tried, with bent brows, to resolve the discord.\nBut I did not take my failure as wholly incompatible with a meaning in\nSoames's mind.  Might it not rather indicate the depth of his meaning?\nAs for the craftsmanship, \"rouged with rust\" seemed to me a fine\nstroke, and \"nor not\" instead of \"and\" had a curious felicity.  I\nwondered who the \"young woman\" was and what she had made of it all.  I\nsadly  suspect that Soames could not have made more of it than she.\nYet even now, if one doesn't try to make any sense at all of the poem,\nand reads it just for the sound, there is a certain grace of cadence.\nSoames was an artist, in so far as he was anything, poor fellow!\n\nIt seemed to me, when first I read \"Fungoids,\" that, oddly enough, the\ndiabolistic side of him was the best.  Diabolism seemed to be a\ncheerful, even a wholesome influence in his life.\n\n\n     NOCTURNE\n\n  Round and round the shutter'd Square\n  I strolled with the Devil's arm in mine.\n  No sound but the scrape of his hoofs was there\n  And the ring of his laughter and mine.\n    We had drunk black wine.\n\n  I scream'd, \"I will race you, Master!\"\n  \"What matter,\" he shriek'd, \"to-night\n  Which of us runs the faster?\n  There is nothing to fear to-night\n    In the foul moon's light!\"\n\n  Then I look'd him in the eyes\n  And I laugh'd full shrill at the lie he told\n  And the gnawing fear he would fain disguise.\n  It was true, what I'd time and again been told:\n    He was old--old.\n\n\nThere was, I felt, quite a swing about that first stanza--a joyous and\nrollicking note of comradeship.  The second was slightly hysterical,\nperhaps.  But I liked the third, it was so bracingly unorthodox, even\naccording to the tenets of Soames's peculiar sect in the faith.  Not\nmuch \"trusting and encouraging\" here!  Soames triumphantly exposing the\ndevil as a liar, and laughing \"full shrill,\" cut a quite heartening\nfigure, I thought, then!  Now, in the light of what befell, none of his\nother poems depresses me so much as \"Nocturne.\"\n\nI looked out for what the metropolitan reviewers would have to say.\nThey seemed to fall into two classes: those who had little to say and\nthose who had nothing.  The second class was the larger, and the words\nof the first were cold; insomuch that\n\n  Strikes a note of modernity. . . .  These tripping numbers.--\"The\n  Preston Telegraph.\"\n\nwas the only lure offered in advertisements by Soames's publisher.  I\nhad hoped that when next I met the poet I could congratulate him on\nhaving made a stir, for I fancied he was not so sure of his intrinsic\ngreatness as he seemed.  I was but able to say, rather coarsely, when\nnext I did see him, that I hoped \"Fungoids\" was \"selling splendidly.\"\nHe looked at me across his glass of absinthe and asked if I had bought\na copy.  His publisher had told him that three had been sold.  I\nlaughed, as at a jest.\n\n\"You don't suppose I CARE, do you?\" he said, with something like a\nsnarl.  I disclaimed the notion.  He added that he was not a tradesman.\nI said mildly that I wasn't, either, and murmured that an artist who\ngave truly new and great things to the world had always to wait long\nfor recognition.  He said he cared not a sou for recognition.  I agreed\nthat the act of creation was its own reward.\n\nHis moroseness might have alienated me if I had regarded myself as a\nnobody.  But ah! hadn't both John Lane and Aubrey Beardsley suggested\nthat I should write an essay for the great new venture that was\nafoot--\"The Yellow Book\"?  And hadn't Henry Harland, as editor,\naccepted my essay?  And wasn't it to be in the very first number?  At\nOxford I was still in statu pupillari.  In London I regarded myself as\nvery much indeed a graduate now--one whom no Soames could ruffle.\nPartly to show off, partly in sheer good-will, I told Soames he ought\nto contribute to \"The Yellow Book.\"  He uttered from the throat a sound\nof scorn for that publication.\n\nNevertheless, I did, a day or two later, tentatively ask Harland if he\nknew anything of the work of a man called Enoch Soames.  Harland paused\nin the midst of his characteristic stride around the room, threw up his\nhands toward the ceiling, and groaned aloud: he had often met \"that\nabsurd creature\" in Paris, and this very morning had received some\npoems in manuscript from him.\n\n\"Has he NO talent?\" I asked.\n\n\"He has an income.  He's all right.\"  Harland was the most joyous of\nmen and most generous of critics, and he hated to talk of anything\nabout which he couldn't be enthusiastic.  So I dropped the subject of\nSoames. The news that Soames had an income did take the edge off\nsolicitude.  I learned afterward that he was the son of an unsuccessful\nand deceased bookseller in Preston, but had inherited an annuity of\nthree hundred pounds from a married aunt, and had no surviving\nrelatives of any kind. Materially, then, he was \"all right.\"  But there\nwas still a spiritual pathos about him, sharpened for me now by the\npossibility that even the praises of \"The Preston Telegraph\" might not\nhave been forthcoming had he not been the son of a Preston man He had a\nsort of weak doggedness which I could not but admire.  Neither he nor\nhis work received the slightest encouragement; but he persisted in\nbehaving as a personage: always he kept his dingy little flag flying.\nWherever congregated the jeunes feroces of the arts, in whatever Soho\nrestaurant they had just discovered, in whatever music-hall they were\nmost frequently, there was Soames in the midst of them, or, rather, on\nthe fringe of them, a dim, but inevitable, figure.  He never sought to\npropitiate his fellow-writers, never bated a jot of his arrogance about\nhis own work or of his contempt for theirs.  To the painters he was\nrespectful, even humble; but for the poets and prosaists of \"The Yellow\nBook\" and later of \"The Savoy\" he had never a word but of scorn.  He\nwasn't resented.  It didn't occur to anybody that he or his Catholic\ndiabolism mattered.  When, in the autumn of '96, he brought out (at his\nown expense, this time) a third book, his last book, nobody said a word\nfor or against it.  I meant, but forgot, to buy it.  I never saw it,\nand am ashamed to say I don't even remember what it was called.  But I\ndid, at the time of its publication, say to Rothenstein that I thought\npoor old Soames was really a rather tragic figure, and that I believed\nhe would literally die for want of recognition.  Rothenstein scoffed.\nHe said I was trying to get credit for a kind heart which I didn't\npossess; and perhaps this was so.  But at the private view of the New\nEnglish Art Club, a few weeks later, I beheld a pastel portrait of\n\"Enoch Soames, Esq.\"  It was very like him, and very like Rothenstein\nto have done it.  Soames was standing near it, in his soft hat and his\nwaterproof cape, all through the afternoon.  Anybody who knew him would\nhave recognized the portrait at a glance, but nobody who didn't know\nhim would have recognized the portrait from its bystander: it \"existed\"\nso much more than he; it was bound to.  Also, it had not that\nexpression of faint happiness which on that day was discernible, yes,\nin Soames's countenance.  Fame had breathed on him.  Twice again in the\ncourse of the month I went to the New English, and on both occasions\nSoames himself was on view there.  Looking back, I regard the close of\nthat exhibition as having been virtually the close of his career.  He\nhad felt the breath of Fame against his cheek--so late, for such a\nlittle while; and at its withdrawal he gave in, gave up, gave out.  He,\nwho had never looked strong or well, looked ghastly now--a shadow of\nthe shade he had once been.  He still frequented the domino-room, but\nhaving lost all wish to excite curiosity, he no longer read books\nthere.  \"You read only at the museum now?\" I asked, with attempted\ncheerfulness.  He said he never went there now.  \"No absinthe there,\"\nhe muttered.  It was the sort of thing that in old days he would have\nsaid for effect; but it carried conviction now.  Absinthe, erst but a\npoint in the \"personality\" he had striven so hard to build up, was\nsolace and necessity now.  He no longer called it \"la sorciere\nglauque.\"   He had shed away all his French phrases.  He had become a\nplain, unvarnished Preston man.\n\nFailure, if it be a plain, unvarnished, complete failure, and even\nthough it be a squalid failure, has always a certain dignity.  I\navoided Soames because he made me feel rather vulgar.  John Lane had\npublished, by this time, two little books of mine, and they had had a\npleasant little success of esteem.  I was a--slight, but\ndefinite--\"personality.\"  Frank Harris had engaged me to kick up my\nheels in \"The Saturday Review,\" Alfred Harmsworth was letting me do\nlikewise in \"The Daily Mail.\"  I was just what Soames wasn't.  And he\nshamed my gloss.  Had I known that he really and firmly believed in the\ngreatness of what he as an artist had achieved, I might not have\nshunned him.  No man who hasn't lost his vanity can be held to have\naltogether failed.  Soames's dignity was an illusion of mine.  One day,\nin the first week of June, 1897, that illusion went.  But on the\nevening of that day Soames went, too.\n\nI had been out most of the morning and, as it was too late to reach\nhome in time for luncheon, I sought the Vingtieme.  This little\nplace--Restaurant du Vingtieme Siecle, to give it its full title--had\nbeen discovered in '96 by the poets and prosaists, but had now been\nmore or less abandoned in favor of some later find.  I don't think it\nlived long enough to justify its name; but at that time there it still\nwas, in Greek Street, a few doors from Soho Square, and almost opposite\nto that house where, in the first years of the century, a little girl,\nand with her a boy named De Quincey, made nightly encampment in\ndarkness and hunger among dust and rats and old legal parchments.  The\nVingtieme was but a small whitewashed room, leading out into the street\nat one end and into a kitchen at the other.  The proprietor and cook\nwas a Frenchman, known to us as Monsieur Vingtieme; the waiters were\nhis two daughters, Rose and Berthe; and the food, according to faith,\nwas good.  The tables were so narrow and were set so close together\nthat there was space for twelve of them, six jutting from each wall.\n\nOnly the two nearest to the door, as I went in, were occupied.  On one\nside sat a tall, flashy, rather Mephistophelian man whom I had seen\nfrom time to time in the domino-room and elsewhere.  On the other side\nsat Soames.  They made a queer contrast in that sunlit room, Soames\nsitting haggard in that hat and cape, which nowhere at any season had I\nseen him doff, and this other, this keenly vital man, at sight of whom\nI more than ever wondered whether he were a diamond merchant, a\nconjurer, or the head of a private detective agency.  I was sure Soames\ndidn't want my company; but I asked, as it would have seemed brutal not\nto, whether I might join him, and took the chair opposite to his.  He\nwas smoking a cigarette, with an untasted salmi of something on his\nplate and a half-empty bottle of Sauterne before him, and he was quite\nsilent.  I said that the preparations for the Jubilee made London\nimpossible.  (I rather liked them, really.) I professed a wish to go\nright away till the whole thing was over.  In vain did I attune myself\nto his gloom.  He seemed not to hear me or even to see me.  I felt that\nhis behavior made me ridiculous in the eyes of the other man.  The\ngangway between the two rows of tables at the Vingtieme was hardly more\nthan two feet wide (Rose and Berthe, in their ministrations, had always\nto edge past each other, quarreling in whispers as they did so), and\nany one at the table abreast of yours was virtually at yours.  I\nthought our neighbor was amused at my failure to interest Soames, and\nso, as I could not explain to him that my insistence was merely\ncharitable, I became silent.  Without turning my head, I had him well\nwithin my range of vision.  I hoped I looked less vulgar than he in\ncontrast with Soames.  I was sure he was not an Englishman, but what\nWAS his nationality?  Though his jet-black hair was en brosse, I did\nnot think he was French.  To Berthe, who waited on him, he spoke French\nfluently, but with a hardly native idiom and accent.  I gathered that\nthis was his first visit to the Vingtieme; but Berthe was offhand in\nher manner to him: he had not made a good impression.  His eyes were\nhandsome, but, like the Vingtieme's tables, too narrow and set too\nclose together.  His nose was predatory, and the points of his\nmustache, waxed up behind his nostrils, gave a fixity to his smile.\nDecidedly, he was sinister.  And my sense of discomfort in his presence\nwas intensified by the scarlet waistcoat which tightly, and so\nunseasonably in June, sheathed his ample chest.  This waistcoat wasn't\nwrong merely because of the heat, either.  It was somehow all wrong in\nitself.  It wouldn't have done on Christmas morning.  It would have\nstruck a jarring note at the first night of \"Hernani.\"  I was trying to\naccount for its wrongness when Soames suddenly and strangely broke\nsilence.  \"A hundred years hence!\" he murmured, as in a trance.\n\n\"We shall not be here,\" I briskly, but fatuously, added.\n\n\"We shall not be here.  No,\" he droned, \"but the museum will still be\njust where it is.  And the reading-room just where it is.  And people\nwill be able to go and read there.\"  He inhaled sharply, and a spasm as\nof actual pain contorted his features.\n\nI wondered what train of thought poor Soames had been following.  He\ndid not enlighten me when he said, after a long pause, \"You think I\nhaven't minded.\"\n\n\"Minded what, Soames?\"\n\n\"Neglect.  Failure.\"\n\n\"FAILURE?\" I said heartily.  \"Failure?\" I repeated vaguely.\n\"Neglect--yes, perhaps; but that's quite another matter.  Of course you\nhaven't been--appreciated.  But what, then?  Any artist who--who\ngives--\"  What I wanted to say was, \"Any artist who gives truly new and\ngreat things to the world has always to wait long for recognition\"; but\nthe flattery would not out: in the face of his misery--a misery so\ngenuine and so unmasked--my lips would not say the words.\n\nAnd then he said them for me.  I flushed.  \"That's what you were going\nto say, isn't it?\" he asked.\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"It's what you said to me three years ago, when 'Fungoids' was\npublished.\"  I flushed the more.  I need not have flushed at all.\n\"It's the only important thing I ever heard you say,\" he continued.\n\"And I've never forgotten it.  It's a true thing.  It's a horrible\ntruth.  But--d'you remember what I answered?  I said, 'I don't care a\nsou for recognition.' And you believed me.  You've gone on believing\nI'm above that sort of thing.  You're shallow.  What should YOU know of\nthe feelings of a man like me?  You imagine that a great artist's faith\nin himself and in the verdict of posterity is enough to keep him happy.\nYou've never guessed at the bitterness and loneliness, the\"--his voice\nbroke; but presently he resumed, speaking with a force that I had never\nknown in him.  \"Posterity!  What use is it to ME?  A dead man doesn't\nknow that people are visiting his grave, visiting his birthplace,\nputting up tablets to him, unveiling statues of him.  A dead man can't\nread the books that are written about him.  A hundred years hence!\nThink of it!  If I could come back to life THEN--just for a few\nhours--and go to the reading-room and READ!  Or, better still, if I\ncould be projected now, at this moment, into that future, into that\nreading-room, just for this one afternoon!  I'd sell myself body and\nsoul to the devil for that!  Think of the pages and pages in the\ncatalogue: 'Soames, Enoch' endlessly--endless editions, commentaries,\nprolegomena, biographies\"--  But here he was interrupted by a sudden\nloud crack of the chair at the next table.  Our neighbor had half risen\nfrom his place.  He was leaning toward us, apologetically intrusive.\n\n\"Excuse--permit me,\" he said softly.  \"I have been unable not to hear.\nMight I take a liberty?  In this little restaurant-sans-facon--might I,\nas the phrase is, cut in?\"\n\nI could but signify our acquiescence.  Berthe had appeared at the\nkitchen door, thinking the stranger wanted his bill.  He waved her away\nwith his cigar, and in another moment had seated himself beside me,\ncommanding a full view of Soames.\n\n\"Though not an Englishman,\" he explained, \"I know my London well, Mr.\nSoames.  Your name and fame--Mr. Beerbohm's, too--very known to me.\nYour point is, who am _I_?\"  He glanced quickly over his shoulder, and\nin a lowered voice said, \"I am the devil.\"\n\nI couldn't help it; I laughed.  I tried not to, I knew there was\nnothing to laugh at, my rudeness shamed me; but--I laughed with\nincreasing volume.  The devil's quiet dignity, the surprise and disgust\nof his raised eyebrows, did but the more dissolve me.  I rocked to and\nfro; I lay back aching; I behaved deplorably.\n\n\"I am a gentleman, and,\" he said with intense emphasis, \"I thought I\nwas in the company of GENTLEMEN.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" I gasped faintly.  \"Oh, don't!\"\n\n\"Curious, nicht wahr?\" I heard him say to Soames.  \"There is a type of\nperson to whom the very mention of my name is--oh, so awfully--funny!\nIn your theaters the dullest comedien needs only to say 'The devil!'\nand right away they give him 'the loud laugh what speaks the vacant\nmind.'  Is it not so?\"\n\nI had now just breath enough to offer my apologies.  He accepted them,\nbut coldly, and re-addressed himself to Soames.\n\n\"I am a man of business,\" he said, \"and always I would put things\nthrough 'right now,' as they say in the States.  You are a poet.  Les\naffaires--you detest them.  So be it.  But with me you will deal, eh?\nWhat you have said just now gives me furiously to hope.\"\n\nSoames had not moved except to light a fresh cigarette.  He sat\ncrouched forward, with his elbows squared on the table, and his head\njust above the level of his hands, staring up at the devil.\n\n\"Go on,\" he nodded.  I had no remnant of laughter in me now.\n\n\"It will be the more pleasant, our little deal,\" the devil went on,\n\"because you are--I mistake not?--a diabolist.\"\n\n\"A Catholic diabolist,\" said Soames.\n\nThe devil accepted the reservation genially.\n\n\"You wish,\" he resumed, \"to visit now--this afternoon as-ever-is--the\nreading-room of the British Museum, yes?  But of a hundred years hence,\nyes?  Parfaitement.  Time--an illusion.  Past and future--they are as\never present as the present, or at any rate only what you call 'just\nround the corner.'  I switch you on to any date.  I project you--pouf!\nYou wish to be in the reading-room just as it will be on the afternoon\nof June 3, 1997?  You wish to find yourself standing in that room, just\npast the swing-doors, this very minute, yes?  And to stay there till\nclosing-time?  Am I right?\"\n\nSoames nodded.\n\nThe devil looked at his watch.  \"Ten past two,\" he said.  \"Closing-time\nin summer same then as now--seven o'clock.  That will give you almost\nfive hours.  At seven o'clock--pouf!--you find yourself again here,\nsitting at this table.  I am dining to-night dans le monde--dans le\nhiglif.  That concludes my present visit to your great city.  I come\nand fetch you here, Mr. Soames, on my way home.\"\n\n\"Home?\" I echoed.\n\n\"Be it never so humble!\" said the devil, lightly.\n\n\"All right,\" said Soames.\n\n\"Soames!\" I entreated.  But my friend moved not a muscle.\n\nThe devil had made as though to stretch forth his hand across the\ntable, but he paused in his gesture.\n\n\"A hundred years hence, as now,\" he smiled, \"no smoking allowed in the\nreading-room.  You would better therefore--\"\n\nSoames removed the cigarette from his mouth and dropped it into his\nglass of Sauterne.\n\n\"Soames!\" again I cried.  \"Can't you\"--but the devil had now stretched\nforth his hand across the table.  He brought it slowly down on the\ntable-cloth.  Soames's chair was empty.  His cigarette floated sodden\nin his wine-glass.  There was no other trace of him.\n\nFor a few moments the devil let his hand rest where it lay, gazing at\nme out of the corners of his eyes, vulgarly triumphant.\n\nA shudder shook me.  With an effort I controlled myself and rose from\nmy chair.  \"Very clever,\" I said condescendingly.  \"But--'The Time\nMachine' is a delightful book, don't you think?  So entirely original!\"\n\n\"You are pleased to sneer,\" said the devil, who had also risen, \"but it\nis one thing to write about an impossible machine; it is a quite other\nthing to be a supernatural power.\"  All the same, I had scored.\n\nBerthe had come forth at the sound of our rising.  I explained to her\nthat Mr. Soames had been called away, and that both he and I would be\ndining here.  It was not until I was out in the open air that I began\nto feel giddy.  I have but the haziest recollection of what I did,\nwhere I wandered, in the glaring sunshine of that endless afternoon.  I\nremember the sound of carpenters' hammers all along Piccadilly and the\nbare chaotic look of the half-erected \"stands.\"  Was it in the Green\nPark or in Kensington Gardens or WHERE was it that I sat on a chair\nbeneath a tree, trying to read an evening paper?  There was a phrase in\nthe leading article that went on repeating itself in my fagged mind:\n\"Little is hidden from this August Lady full of the garnered wisdom of\nsixty years of Sovereignty.\"  I remember wildly conceiving a letter (to\nreach Windsor by an express messenger told to await answer): \"Madam:\nWell knowing that your Majesty is full of the garnered wisdom of sixty\nyears of Sovereignty, I venture to ask your advice in the following\ndelicate matter.  Mr. Enoch Soames, whose poems you may or may not\nknow--\" Was there NO way of helping him, saving him?  A bargain was a\nbargain, and I was the last man to aid or abet any one in wriggling out\nof a reasonable obligation.  I wouldn't have lifted a little finger to\nsave Faust. But poor Soames!  Doomed to pay without respite an eternal\nprice for nothing but a fruitless search and a bitter disillusioning.\n\nOdd and uncanny it seemed to me that he, Soames, in the flesh, in the\nwaterproof cape, was at this moment living in the last decade of the\nnext century, poring over books not yet written, and seeing and seen by\nmen not yet born.  Uncannier and odder still that to-night and evermore\nhe would be in hell.  Assuredly, truth was stranger than fiction.\n\nEndless that afternoon was.  Almost I wished I had gone with Soames,\nnot, indeed, to stay in the reading-room, but to sally forth for a\nbrisk sight-seeing walk around a new London.  I wandered restlessly out\nof the park I had sat in.  Vainly I tried to imagine myself an ardent\ntourist from the eighteenth century.  Intolerable was the strain of the\nslow-passing and empty minutes.  Long before seven o'clock I was back\nat the Vingtieme.\n\nI sat there just where I had sat for luncheon.  Air came in listlessly\nthrough the open door behind me.  Now and again Rose or Berthe appeared\nfor a moment.  I had told them I would not order any dinner till Mr.\nSoames came.  A hurdy-gurdy began to play, abruptly drowning the noise\nof a quarrel between some Frenchmen farther up the street.  Whenever\nthe tune was changed I heard the quarrel still raging.  I had bought\nanother evening paper on my way.  I unfolded it.  My eyes gazed ever\naway from it to the clock over the kitchen door.\n\nFive minutes now to the hour!  I remembered that clocks in restaurants\nare kept five minutes fast.  I concentrated my eyes on the paper.  I\nvowed I would not look away from it again.  I held it upright, at its\nfull width, close to my face, so that I had no view of anything but it.\nRather a tremulous sheet?  Only because of the draft, I told myself.\n\nMy arms gradually became stiff; they ached; but I could not drop\nthem--now.  I had a suspicion, I had a certainty.  Well, what, then?\nWhat else had I come for?  Yet I held tight that barrier of newspaper.\nOnly the sound of Berthe's brisk footstep from the kitchen enabled me,\nforced me, to drop it, and to utter:\n\n\"What shall we have to eat, Soames?\"\n\n\"Il est souffrant, ce pauvre Monsieur Soames?\" asked Berthe.\n\n\"He's only--tired.\"  I asked her to get some wine--Burgundy--and\nwhatever food might be ready.  Soames sat crouched forward against the\ntable exactly as when last I had seen him.  It was as though he had\nnever moved--he who had moved so unimaginably far.  Once or twice in\nthe afternoon it had for an instant occurred to me that perhaps his\njourney was not to be fruitless, that perhaps we had all been wrong in\nour estimate of the works of Enoch Soames.  That we had been horribly\nright was horribly clear from the look of him.  But, \"Don't be\ndiscouraged,\" I falteringly said.  \"Perhaps it's only that you--didn't\nleave enough time.  Two, three centuries hence, perhaps--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" his voice came; \"I've thought of that.\"\n\n\"And now--now for the more immediate future!  Where are you going to\nhide?  How would it be if you caught the Paris express from Charing\nCross?  Almost an hour to spare.  Don't go on to Paris.  Stop at\nCalais.  Live in Calais.  He'd never think of looking for you in\nCalais.\"\n\n\"It's like my luck,\" he said, \"to spend my last hours on earth with an\nass.\"  But I was not offended.  \"And a treacherous ass,\" he strangely\nadded, tossing across to me a crumpled bit of paper which he had been\nholding in his hand.  I glanced at the writing on it--some sort of\ngibberish, apparently.  I laid it impatiently aside.\n\n\"Come, Soames, pull yourself together!  This isn't a mere matter of\nlife or death.  It's a question of eternal torment, mind you!  You\ndon't mean to say you're going to wait limply here till the devil comes\nto fetch you.\"\n\n\"I can't do anything else.  I've no choice.\"\n\n\"Come!  This is 'trusting and encouraging' with a vengeance!  This is\ndiabolism run mad!\"  I filled his glass with wine.  \"Surely, now that\nyou've SEEN the brute--\"\n\n\"It's no good abusing him.\"\n\n\"You must admit there's nothing Miltonic about him, Soames.\"\n\n\"I don't say he's not rather different from what I expected.\"\n\n\"He's a vulgarian, he's a swell mobs-man, he's the sort of man who\nhangs about the corridors of trains going to the Riviera and steals\nladies' jewel-cases.  Imagine eternal torment presided over by HIM!\"\n\n\"You don't suppose I look forward to it, do you?\"\n\n\"Then why not slip quietly out of the way?\"\n\nAgain and again I filled his glass, and always, mechanically, he\nemptied it; but the wine kindled no spark of enterprise in him.  He did\nnot eat, and I myself ate hardly at all.  I did not in my heart believe\nthat any dash for freedom could save him.  The chase would be swift,\nthe capture certain.  But better anything than this passive, meek,\nmiserable waiting.  I told Soames that for the honor of the human race\nhe ought to make some show of resistance.  He asked what the human race\nhad ever done for him.  \"Besides,\" he said, \"can't you understand that\nI'm in his power? You saw him touch me, didn't you?  There's an end of\nit.  I've no will.  I'm sealed.\"\n\nI made a gesture of despair.  He went on repeating the word \"sealed.\"\nI began to realize that the wine had clouded his brain.  No wonder!\nFoodless he had gone into futurity, foodless he still was.  I urged him\nto eat, at any rate, some bread.  It was maddening to think that he,\nwho had so much to tell, might tell nothing.  \"How was it all,\" I\nasked, \"yonder?  Come, tell me your adventures!\"\n\n\"They'd make first-rate 'copy,' wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry for you, Soames, and I make all possible allowances;\nbut what earthly right have you to insinuate that I should make 'copy,'\nas you call it, out of you?\"\n\nThe poor fellow pressed his hands to his forehead.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said.  \"I had some reason, I know.  I'll try to\nremember.  He sat plunged in thought.\n\n\"That's right.  Try to remember everything.  Eat a little more bread.\nWhat did the reading-room look like?\"\n\n\"Much as usual,\" he at length muttered.\n\n\"Many people there?\"\n\n\"Usual sort of number.\"\n\n\"What did they look like?\"\n\nSoames tried to visualize them.\n\n\"They all,\" he presently remembered, \"looked very like one another.\"\n\nMy mind took a fearsome leap.\n\n\"All dressed in sanitary woolen?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so.  Grayish-yellowish stuff.\"\n\n\"A sort of uniform?\"  He nodded.  \"With a number on it perhaps--a\nnumber on a large disk of metal strapped round the left arm?  D. K. F.\n78,910--that sort of thing?\"  It was even so.  \"And all of them, men\nand women alike, looking very well cared for?  Very Utopian, and\nsmelling rather strongly of carbolic, and all of them quite hairless?\"\nI was right every time.  Soames was only not sure whether the men and\nwomen were hairless or shorn.  \"I hadn't time to look at them very\nclosely,\" he explained.\n\n\"No, of course not.  But--\"\n\n\"They stared at ME, I can tell you.  I attracted a great deal of\nattention.\"  At last he had done that!  \"I think I rather scared them.\nThey moved away whenever I came near.  They followed me about, at a\ndistance, wherever I went.  The men at the round desk in the middle\nseemed to have a sort of panic whenever I went to make inquiries.\"\n\n\"What did you do when you arrived?\"\n\nWell, he had gone straight to the catalogue, of course,--to the S\nvolumes,--and had stood long before SN-SOF, unable to take this volume\nout of the shelf because his heart was beating so.  At first, he said,\nhe wasn't disappointed; he only thought there was some new arrangement.\nHe went to the middle desk and asked where the catalogue of\ntwentieth-century books was kept.  He gathered that there was still\nonly one catalogue.  Again he looked up his name, stared at the three\nlittle pasted slips he had known so well.  Then he went and sat down\nfor a long time.\n\n\"And then,\" he droned, \"I looked up the 'Dictionary of National\nBiography,' and some encyclopedias.  I went back to the middle desk and\nasked what was the best modern book on late nineteenth-century\nliterature.  They told me Mr. T. K. Nupton's book was considered the\nbest.  I looked it up in the catalogue and filled in a form for it.  It\nwas brought to me.  My name wasn't in the index, but--yes!\" he said\nwith a sudden change of tone, \"that's what I'd forgotten.  Where's that\nbit of paper?  Give it me back.\"\n\nI, too, had forgotten that cryptic screed.  I found it fallen on the\nfloor, and handed it to him.\n\nHe smoothed it out, nodding and smiling at me disagreeably.\n\n\"I found myself glancing through Nupton's book,\" he resumed.  \"Not very\neasy reading.  Some sort of phonetic spelling.  All the modern books I\nsaw were phonetic.\"\n\n\"Then I don't want to hear any more, Soames, please.\"\n\n\"The proper names seemed all to be spelt in the old way.  But for that\nI mightn't have noticed my own name.\"\n\n\"Your own name?  Really?  Soames, I'm VERY glad.\"\n\n\"And yours.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I thought I should find you waiting here to-night, so I took the\ntrouble to copy out the passage.  Read it.\"\n\nI snatched the paper.  Soames's handwriting was characteristically dim.\nIt and the noisome spelling and my excitement made me all the slower to\ngrasp what T. K. Nupton was driving at.\n\nThe document lies before me at this moment.  Strange that the words I\nhere copy out for you were copied out for me by poor Soames just\neighty-two years hence!\n\nFrom page 234 of \"Inglish Littracher 1890-1900\" bi T. K. Nupton,\npublishd bi th Stait, 1992.\n\nFr egzarmpl, a riter ov th time, naimed Max Beerbohm, hoo woz stil\nalive in th twentith senchri, rote a stauri in wich e pautraid an\nimmajnari karrakter kauld \"Enoch Soames\"--a thurd-rait poit hoo beleevz\nimself a grate jeneus an maix a bargin with th Devvl in auder ter no\nwot posterriti thinx ov im!

Thank hevvn we hav no Enoch\nSoameses amung us to-dai!\n\n\nI found that by murmuring the words aloud (a device which I commend to\nmy reader) I was able to master them little by little.  The clearer\nthey became, the greater was my bewilderment, my distress and horror.\nThe whole thing was a nightmare.  Afar, the great grisly background of\nwhat was in store for the poor dear art of letters; here, at the table,\nfixing on me a gaze that made me hot all over, the poor fellow\nwhom--whom evidently--but no: whatever down-grade my character might\ntake in coming years, I should never be such a brute as to--\n\nAgain I examined the screed.  \"Immajnari.\"  But here Soames was, no\nmore imaginary, alas! than I.  And \"labud\"--what on earth was that?\n(To this day I have never made out that word.) \"It's all\nvery--baffling,\" I at length stammered.\n\nSoames said nothing, but cruelly did not cease to look at me.\n\n\"Are you sure,\" I temporized, \"quite sure you copied the thing out\ncorrectly?\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it's this wretched Nupton who must have made--must be\ngoing to make--some idiotic mistake.  Look here Soames, you know me\nbetter than to suppose that I--  After all, the name Max Beerbohm is\nnot at all an uncommon one, and there must be several Enoch Soameses\nrunning around, or, rather, Enoch Soames is a name that might occur to\nany one writing a story.  And I don't write stories; I'm an essayist,\nan observer, a recorder.  I admit that it's an extraordinary\ncoincidence.  But you must see--\"\n\n\"I see the whole thing,\" said Soames, quietly.  And he added, with a\ntouch of his old manner, but with more dignity than I had ever known in\nhim, \"Parlons d'autre chose.\"\n\nI accepted that suggestion very promptly.  I returned straight to the\nmore immediate future.  I spent most of the long evening in renewed\nappeals to Soames to come away and seek refuge somewhere.  I remember\nsaying at last that if indeed I was destined to write about him, the\nsupposed \"stauri\" had better have at least a happy ending.  Soames\nrepeated those last three words in a tone of intense scorn.\n\n\"In life and in art,\" he said, \"all that matters is an INEVITABLE\nending.\"\n\n\"But,\" I urged more hopefully than I felt, \"an ending that can be\navoided ISN'T inevitable.\"\n\n\"You aren't an artist,\" he rasped.  \"And you're so hopelessly not an\nartist that, so far from being able to imagine a thing and make it seem\ntrue, you're going to make even a true thing seem as if you'd made it\nup.  You're a miserable bungler.  And it's like my luck.\"\n\nI protested that the miserable bungler was not I, was not going to be\nI, but T. K. Nupton; and we had a rather heated argument, in the thick\nof which it suddenly seemed to me that Soames saw he was in the wrong:\nhe had quite physically cowered.  But I wondered why--and now I guessed\nwith a cold throb just why--he stared so past me.  The bringer of that\n\"inevitable ending\" filled the doorway.\n\nI managed to turn in my chair and to say, not without a semblance of\nlightness, \"Aha, come in!\"  Dread was indeed rather blunted in me by\nhis looking so absurdly like a villain in a melodrama.  The sheen of\nhis tilted hat and of his shirt-front, the repeated twists he was\ngiving to his mustache, and most of all the magnificence of his sneer,\ngave token that he was there only to be foiled.\n\nHe was at our table in a stride.  \"I am sorry,\" he sneered witheringly,\n\"to break up your pleasant party, but--\"\n\n\"You don't; you complete it,\" I assured him.  \"Mr. Soames and I want to\nhave a little talk with you.  Won't you sit?  Mr. Soames got nothing,\nfrankly nothing, by his journey this afternoon.  We don't wish to say\nthat the whole thing was a swindle, a common swindle.  On the contrary,\nwe believe you meant well.  But of course the bargain, such as it was,\nis off.\"\n\nThe devil gave no verbal answer.  He merely looked at Soames and\npointed with rigid forefinger to the door.  Soames was wretchedly\nrising from his chair when, with a desperate, quick gesture, I swept\ntogether two dinner-knives that were on the table, and laid their\nblades across each other.  The devil stepped sharp back against the\ntable behind him, averting his face and shuddering.\n\n\"You are not superstitious!\" he hissed.\n\n\"Not at all,\" I smiled.\n\n\"Soames,\" he said as to an underling, but without turning his face,\n\"put those knives straight!\"\n\nWith an inhibitive gesture to my friend, \"Mr. Soames,\" I said\nemphatically to the devil, \"is a Catholic diabolist\"; but my poor\nfriend did the devil's bidding, not mine; and now, with his master's\neyes again fixed on him, he arose, he shuffled past me.  I tried to\nspeak.  It was he that spoke.  \"Try,\" was the prayer he threw back at\nme as the devil pushed him roughly out through the door--\"TRY to make\nthem know that I did exist!\"\n\nIn another instant I, too, was through that door.  I stood staring all\nways, up the street, across it, down it.  There was moonlight and\nlamplight, but there was not Soames nor that other.\n\nDazed, I stood there.  Dazed, I turned back at length into the little\nroom, and I suppose I paid Berthe or Rose for my dinner and luncheon\nand for Soames's; I hope so, for I never went to the Vingtieme again.\nEver since that night I have avoided Greek Street altogether.  And for\nyears I did not set foot even in Soho Square, because on that same\nnight it was there that I paced and loitered, long and long, with some\nsuch dull sense of hope as a man has in not straying far from the place\nwhere he has lost something.  \"Round and round the shutter'd\nSquare\"--that line came back to me on my lonely beat, and with it the\nwhole stanza, ringing in my brain and bearing in on me how tragically\ndifferent from the happy scene imagined by him was the poet's actual\nexperience of that prince in whom of all princes we should put not our\ntrust!\n\nBut strange how the mind of an essayist, be it never so stricken, roves\nand ranges!  I remember pausing before a wide door-step and wondering\nif perchance it was on this very one that the young De Quincey lay ill\nand faint while poor Ann flew as fast as her feet would carry her to\nOxford Street, the \"stony-hearted stepmother\" of them both, and came\nback bearing that \"glass of port wine and spices\" but for which he\nmight, so he thought, actually have died.  Was this the very door-step\nthat the old De Quincey used to revisit in homage?  I pondered Ann's\nfate, the cause of her sudden vanishing from the ken of her boy friend;\nand presently I blamed myself for letting the past override the\npresent.  Poor vanished Soames!\n\nAnd for myself, too, I began to be troubled.  What had I better do?\nWould there be a hue and cry--\"Mysterious Disappearance of an Author,\"\nand all that?  He had last been seen lunching and dining in my company.\nHadn't I better get a hansom and drive straight to Scotland Yard?  They\nwould think I was a lunatic.  After all, I reassured myself, London was\na very large place, and one very dim figure might easily drop out of it\nunobserved, now especially, in the blinding glare of the near Jubilee.\nBetter say nothing at all, I thought.\n\nAND I was right.  Soames's disappearance made no stir at all.  He was\nutterly forgotten before any one, so far as I am aware, noticed that he\nwas no longer hanging around.  Now and again some poet or prosaist may\nhave said to another, \"What has become of that man Soames?\" but I never\nheard any such question asked.  As for his landlady in Dyott Street, no\ndoubt he had paid her weekly, and what possessions he may have had in\nhis rooms were enough to save her from fretting.  The solicitor through\nwhom he was paid his annuity may be presumed to have made inquiries,\nbut no echo of these resounded.  There was something rather ghastly to\nme in the general unconsciousness that Soames had existed, and more\nthan once I caught myself wondering whether Nupton, that babe unborn,\nwere going to be right in thinking him a figment of my brain.\n\nIn that extract from Nupton's repulsive book there is one point which\nperhaps puzzles you.  How is it that the author, though I have here\nmentioned him by name and have quoted the exact words he is going to\nwrite, is not going to grasp the obvious corollary that I have invented\nnothing?  The answer can be only this: Nupton will not have read the\nlater passages of this memoir.  Such lack of thoroughness is a serious\nfault in any one who undertakes to do scholar's work.  And I hope these\nwords will meet the eye of some contemporary rival to Nupton and be the\nundoing of Nupton.\n\nI like to think that some time between 1992 and 1997 somebody will have\nlooked up this memoir, and will have forced on the world his inevitable\nand startling conclusions.  And I have reason for believing that this\nwill be so.  You realize that the reading-room into which Soames was\nprojected by the devil was in all respects precisely as it will be on\nthe afternoon of June 3, 1997.  You realize, therefore, that on that\nafternoon, when it comes round, there the selfsame crowd will be, and\nthere Soames will be, punctually, he and they doing precisely what they\ndid before.  Recall now Soames's account of the sensation he made.  You\nmay say that the mere difference of his costume was enough to make him\nsensational in that uniformed crowd.  You wouldn't say so if you had\never seen him, and I assure you that in no period would Soames be\nanything but dim.  The fact that people are going to stare at him and\nfollow him around and seem afraid of him, can be explained only on the\nhypothesis that they will somehow have been prepared for his ghostly\nvisitation. They will have been awfully waiting to see whether he\nreally would come.  And when he does come the effect will of course\nbe--awful.\n\nAn authentic, guaranteed, proved ghost, but; only a ghost, alas!  Only\nthat.  In his first visit Soames was a creature of flesh and blood,\nwhereas the creatures among whom he was projected were but ghosts, I\ntake it--solid, palpable, vocal, but unconscious and automatic ghosts,\nin a building that was itself an illusion.  Next time that building and\nthose creatures will be real.  It is of Soames that there will be but\nthe semblance.  I wish I could think him destined to revisit the world\nactually, physically, consciously.  I wish he had this one brief\nescape, this one small treat, to look forward to.  I never forget him\nfor long.  He is where he is and forever.  The more rigid moralists\namong you may say he has only himself to blame.  For my part, I think\nhe has been very hardly used. It is well that vanity should be\nchastened; and Enoch Soames's vanity was, I admit, above the average,\nand called for special treatment.  But there was no need for\nvindictiveness.  You say he contracted to pay the price he is paying.\nYes; but I maintain that he was induced to do so by fraud.  Well\ninformed in all things, the devil must have known that my friend would\ngain nothing by his visit to futurity.  The whole thing was a very\nshabby trick.  The more I think of it, the more detestable the devil\nseems to me.\n\nOf him I have caught sight several times, here and there, since that\nday at the Vingtieme.  Only once, however, have I seen him at close\nquarters.  This was a couple of years ago, in Paris.  I was walking one\nafternoon along the rue d'Antin, and I saw him advancing from the\nopposite direction, overdressed as ever, and swinging an ebony cane and\naltogether behaving as though the whole pavement belonged to him.  At\nthought of Enoch Soames and the myriads of other sufferers eternally in\nthis brute's dominion, a great cold wrath filled me, and I drew myself\nup to my full height.  But--well, one is so used to nodding and smiling\nin the street to anybody whom one knows that the action becomes almost\nindependent of oneself; to prevent it requires a very sharp effort and\ngreat presence of mind.  I was miserably aware, as I passed the devil,\nthat I nodded and smiled to him.  And my shame was the deeper and\nhotter because he, if you please, stared straight at me with the utmost\nhaughtiness.\n\nTo be cut, deliberately cut, by HIM!  I was, I still am, furious at\nhaving had that happen to me.\n\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note: I have closed contractions in the text; e.g.,\n\"does n't\" has become \"doesn't\" etc.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Enoch Soames, by Max Beerbohm",
